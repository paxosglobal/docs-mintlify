All onboarding requirements are determined in conjunction with [Support](https://support.paxos.com/hc/en-us).
Specific requirements differ, depending on the business type and structure, licenses held, operating jurisdictions, among other factors.
Typically:

- **Payment processors** without requisite licensure can leverage the streamlined Paxos white-label onboarding process.
- **Payment processors** with an appropriate license, for example a [BitLicense](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/virtual_currency_businesses), can use the Paxos APIs to process stablecoin payments without onboarding Sellers.

Most onboarding procedures include using the [Identity](/api-reference/identity) and [Account](/api-reference/accounts) APIs to represent an end user on the Paxos Platform.
