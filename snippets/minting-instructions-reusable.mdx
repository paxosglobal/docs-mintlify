<Tip>

 Minting instructions are reusable!

Save the minting instructions to make them easy to retrieve from [Saved Instructions][saved-instructions]. You can reuse the saved instructions any time you need to mint a stablecoin. Saved instructions are immutable, so once configured they always execute the exact same way.
