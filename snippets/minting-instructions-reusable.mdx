<Tip>
**Minting instructions are reusable!**

Save the minting instructions to make them easy to retrieve from [Saved Instructions](https://dashboard.paxos.com/dashboard/saved-instructions). You can reuse the saved instructions any time you need to mint a stablecoin. Saved instructions are immutable, so once configured they always execute the exact same way.
