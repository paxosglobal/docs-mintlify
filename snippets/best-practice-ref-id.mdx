    <p><strong>Best Practice</strong></p>
    <p>Whenever possible, include your own unique identifier in the request using <code>ref_id</code>.
    Doing so helps to protect against submitting the same request twice, as the second request with the same <code>ref_id</code> will be rejected with <code>409 already exists</code>.
    The <code>ref_id</code> can also be used in many query parameters.</p>
