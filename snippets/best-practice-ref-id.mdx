 Best Practice

Whenever possible, include your own unique identifier in the request using `ref_id`.
Doing so helps to protect against submitting the same request twice, as the second request with the same `ref_id` will be rejected with `409 already exists`.
The `ref_id` can also be used in many query parameters.
