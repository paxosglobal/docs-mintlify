To move USD onto the platform, first use [Create Fiat Deposit Instructions](/api-reference/endpoints/fiat-transfers/create-fiat-deposit-instructions) to retrieve the Paxos banking information and specify which [Profile](/api-reference/endpoints/profiles) balance to credit.
Then, use the returned banking information, found in `fiat_network_instructions` object, along with the `memo_id`, to transfer funds to Paxos.
