Most API endpoints require authentication with a **Client ID** and **Secret**. Each **Client ID** has a specific set of allowed scopes (**Permissions**) to access API endpoints. Scopes allowed on an API client may be updated at any time in the Dashboard **Admin > API Management** section.

<Tip>
Contact your [Entity Manager](/dashboard/roles#entity-manager) if you need permissions to manage API credentials.
</Tip>

When setting scopes, Paxos recommends following the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) and only allow scopes required by a specific application. Scopes for each endpoint are listed in the **Authorizations** section in the [API Reference docs](/api-reference/introduction). The [Market Data](/api-reference/endpoints/market-data) and most [Pricing](/api-reference/endpoints/pricing) endpoints do not require authorization.
