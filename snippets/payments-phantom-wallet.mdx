<Accordion title="Example: Buyer's Wallet" id="buyer-wallet">

We [airdropped Solana Devnet](https://faucet.solana.com/) to a self-custody wallet.
We also used the [Paxos Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.paxos.com/) to transfer some [PYUSD on Solana Devnet](/guides/stablecoin/pyusd) to the Buyer's wallet.
The same Buyer wallet is used to simulate a purchase as well as a refund.
