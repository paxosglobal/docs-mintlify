- **v2 API**: Add optional field `self_match_prevention_id` to Create Order. This field is used to prevent matching against an opposite side order submitted by the same Crypto Brokerage customer. If this field is not submitted, an order that matches against another order submitted by the same customer will cancel the original resting order. {/* https://itbitwiki.atlassian.net/browse/CORX-539 */}
