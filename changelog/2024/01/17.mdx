- **v1 API, v2 API**: The `address1`, `city` and `province`  fields are no longer explicitly marked as required in the `MailingAddress` object. The v1 API CreateBankAccount endpoint and the v2 API Create Fiat Account and Update Fiat Account endpoints will continue to validate these fields if they exist. {/* https://itbitwiki.atlassian.net/browse/TFR-2767 */}
