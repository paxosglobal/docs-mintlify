- **FIX**: Add `SelfMatchPreventionID` (tag 2362) to prevent matching against an opposite side order submitted by the same Crypto Brokerage customer. If this tag is not submitted, an order that matches against another order submitted by the same customer will cancel the original resting order. {/* https://itbitwiki.atlassian.net/browse/CORX-539 */}
