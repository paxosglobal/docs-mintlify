- **Reconciliation Reporting**: We're enhancing our reconciliation reports with two new fields: `OrchestrationID` links all related transactions within a single end-to-end flow. `OrchestrationRuleID` identifies which automation rule triggered the transaction set. These additions make it easier to track multi-step transactions and map them to their triggering rules, improving audit trails and simplifying reconciliation processes for treasury and enterprise payment operations. {/* https://itbitwiki.atlassian.net/browse/AO-256 */}
