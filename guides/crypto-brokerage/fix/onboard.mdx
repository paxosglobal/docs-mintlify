Set up and test a FIX connection in both the Sandbox and Production environments.
Connect to the Sandbox environment first for testing purposes.
Once the connection is working in Sandbox, follow a similar procedure for the Production connection.

<Tip>

Learn more about [FIX Best Practices](/guides/crypto-brokerage/fix/best-practices), including how to use multiple connections and managing sequence number resets.

</Tip>

## 1. Set Up Paxos Account

To gain access, create a Paxos Account and Support will guide you through the process.
### Sandbox

Go to https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com and create an **Institution** Account in the Sandbox environment.

Use an active email address when signing up: Paxos will send a verification email to the address on file.
Once the email is verified, complete the registration process.

<Info>

When creating the Sandbox Account:
- Do not submit documents.
- Use placeholder (dummy) text for all text fields **except** for the email address.

</Info>
### Production

Contact support@paxos.com before creating a Production Account.
## 2. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

<FixCSR />

## 3. Set Up SSL

<FixSSL />

Once complete, [test](/guides/crypto-brokerage/fix/certify) your connection to our servers.
Contact support@paxos.com with test results of for help with an alternative to [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/).
