Paxos recommends following FIX industry best practices, in addition to the items outlined below.

## Identity Mapping

Use the following table to map Paxos identify information to the corresponding FIX tag.

| Paxos Identity | FIX Tag |
| --- | --- |
| Customer ID | Account (1) |
| Profile ID | ClientID (109) |

## Sequence Number Management

Periodically disconnecting the FIX connection.
Resetting the message sequence number promotes a stable trading environment for all users.
Paxos forces a disconnect and reset of sequence numbers weekly for all sessions.

The exact time when the disconnect and reset to sequence numbers happen is discussed during the onboarding process.
Clients must configure their FIX engines to expect a disconnect and sequence number reset at the agreed schedule, failure to do so will result in an invalid FIX session due to mismatching sequence numbers.

Schedule times follow the US Eastern Time Zone (ET), an area five hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT-5) during the winter months (referred to as Eastern Standard Time or EST) and four hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT-4) during the summer months (referred to as Eastern Daylight Time or EDT).

## Cancel on Disconnect

Cancel on Disconnect is enabled by default.
When a disconnection occurs, the service automatically submits a cancel request for all open orders.

## Use Multiple connections

FIX supports multiple connections per trading account.
Please submit a request to support@paxos.com to request additional connections. 

## Implementation Testing

Test the FIX implementation by following the [FIX certification process](/fix/certify) in the Sandbox environment prior to going live in Production.
