### What's the difference between an order and a quote?
Orders execute in part or in full depending on the market conditions and properties of the order at the time of submission.

Quotes are "held rates" offered by Paxos to buy or sell assets at a specific price for a specific period of time - for example, 
the option to buy BTC within the next 30 seconds for $8,000.

### Should I use quotes or orders for my integration?
The answer is highly dependent on business needs and best discussed with [Support](https://support.paxos.com/hc/en-us).

Generally speaking, retail users appreciate the predictability of quotes while experienced traders require the flexibility and 
control offered by orders to execute their specific strategy.

### Are the workflows for quotes and orders similar or different?
They are different. Please see the [HRQ Quickstart Guide][quote-quickstart] and [Orders Reference Documents][v2-orders] 
for more information on each service.

### Is it possible to cancel a Created Quote Execution?
Paxos guarantees the settlement for created quote execution, there is no option to cancel an already created quote.
