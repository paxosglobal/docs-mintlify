## Pay-ins

- [List Transfers](/api-reference/endpoints/transfers/list-transfers): When [monitoring a pay-in](/payments/quickstart#pay-in-monitor-reconcile), a `PENDING` a transaction is being confirmed. Depending on the network, confirmation can take from seconds to minutes. Transactions with a `COMPLETED` status have received sufficient confirmations. The `FAILED` status means the transaction was denied.
- [Create Fiat Withdrawal](/api-reference/endpoints/fiat-transfers/create-fiat-withdrawal): When [withdrawing USD to a bank account](/payments/quickstart#pay-in-withdraw-fiat), the `PENDING` status means the request has been made and is being processes. Depending on the withdrawal type, it can take up to a few days for the transaction to complete. When the transfer to the bank account is successful, the status changes to `COMPLETED`.

The `COMPLETED` status means the USD funds have been credited to the given Profile.
- [Create Crypto Withdrawal](/api-reference/endpoints/crypto-withdrawals/create-crypto-withdrawal): When [issuing a crypto refund](/payments/quickstart#refunds), the withdrawal has an initial status of `PENDING`, meaning Paxos has received the request and is processing the transaction. Depending on the network, confirmation can take from seconds to minutes.
