Transactions with a `COMPLETED` status have received sufficient confirmations. The `FAILED` status means the transaction was denied.

- [Create Crypto Withdrawal][create-crypto-withdrawal]: When [issuing a crypto refund][refunds], the withdrawal has an initial status of `PENDING`, meaning Paxos has received the request and is processing the transaction.
