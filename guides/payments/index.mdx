## Pay-ins Workflow

![Payments](/images/payments.png)

The pay-ins workflow involves two key personas: a Buyer purchasing goods or services using stablecoins and a Seller. 
The Seller represents either a merchant that provides goods or services, or a payment processor acting as the intermediary to facilitate the transaction.
Most pay-in integrations follow a similar workflow for the Seller:

1. [Add a crypto deposit address](/guides/payments/quickstart#pay-in-add-deposit-address) for a designated Profile, using one of the [supported blockchains](/guides/payments/faq#supported-assets).
1. To [use stablecoins for pay-ins](/guides/payments/quickstart#receive-payment), share the crypto deposit address with Buyers as a checkout option.

1. Configure a [pay-in monitoring and reconciliation](/guides/payments/quickstart#pay-in-monitor-reconcile) request to confirm Pay-in transactions on the Paxos Platform.
1. [Withdraw USD](/guides/payments/quickstart#pay-in-withdraw-fiat) to a bank account.
## Refunds Workflow

Issuing a refund is similar to pay-ins, except the funding flow is reversed: USD is first moved onto the Paxos Platform and then the stablecoin refund is sent to the Buyer's designated wallet.
Most refund integrations follow a similar workflow for the Seller:

1. [Send USD](/guides/payments/quickstart#refund-fund-account) to a designated refund account.
1. [Initiate a crypto withdrawal](/guides/payments/quickstart#refund-initiate) to the Buyer's designated wallet address, using one of the [supported blockchains](/guides/payments/faq#supported-assets).
1. Configure a [refund monitoring and reconciliation](/guides/payments/quickstart#refund-monitor-reconcile) request to confirm Pay-in transactions on the Paxos Platform.
