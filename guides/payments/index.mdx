- Reconcile transactions on the Paxos Platform.
- Settle USD directly to your bank account.

In the documentation, a payment is considered to be the total amount processed, including both the incoming payment (pay-in) and returned payment (refund).

## Pay-ins Workflow

![Payments](/images/payments.png)

The pay-ins workflow involves two key personas: a Buyer purchasing goods or services using stablecoins and a Seller. 
The Seller represents either a merchant that provides goods or services, or a payment processor acting as the intermediary to facilitate the transaction.
Most pay-in integrations follow a similar workflow for the Seller:

1. [Add a crypto deposit address][crypto-deposit-address] for a designated Profile, using one of the [supported blockchains][supported-assets].
1. To [use stablecoins for pay-ins][disseminate], share the crypto deposit address with Buyers as a checkout option.<PaymentsConnectorTip />
1. Configure a [pay-in monitoring and reconciliation][reconcile] request to confirm Pay-in transactions on the Paxos Platform.
1. [Withdraw USD] to a bank account.
## Refunds Workflow

Issuing a refund is similar to pay-ins, except the funding flow is reversed: USD is first moved onto the Paxos Platform and then the stablecoin refund is sent to the Buyer's designated wallet.
Most refund integrations follow a similar workflow for the Seller:

1. [Send USD][send-usd] to a designated refund account.
1. [Initiate a crypto withdrawal][initiate-withdrawal] to the Buyer's designated wallet address, using one of the [supported blockchains][supported-assets].
1. Configure a [refund monitoring and reconciliation][refund-reconcile] request to confirm Pay-in transactions on the Paxos Platform.
