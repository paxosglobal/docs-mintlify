Global Dollar (USDG) is a single-currency stablecoin (SCS) pegged to the US dollar, issued by Paxos Digital Singapore Pte. Ltd. (PDS), which is a Major Payments Institution supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Built for payments, settlements and treasury, USDG can be used as an interoperable building block for open-source smart contracts, enabling developers to create new use-cases, products and services with USDG. All cash and cash equivalent reserve assets are held in segregated accounts to protect user assets. USDG is available for purchase and fully redeemable from Paxos on a one-to-one basis for US dollars (1 USDG = 1 USD).
