Global Dollar (USDG) is a single-currency stablecoin (SCS) pegged to the US dollar, issued by Paxos Digital Singapore Pte. Ltd. (PDS) and is compliant with the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) forthcoming stablecoin framework.
Built for payments, settlements and treasury, USDG can be used as an interoperable building block for open-source smart contracts, enabling developers to create new use-cases, products and services with USDG.
All cash and cash equivalent reserve assets are held in segregated accounts to protect user assets.
USDG is available for purchase and fully redeemable from Paxos on a one-to-one basis for US dollars (1 USDG = 1 USD).

## USDG Transparency

Paxos is committed to ensuring the public availability of reports on the USDG reserve assets.
To ensure transparency on USDG reserve assets, Paxos publishes monthly reports on reserve composition as well as attestations reports issued by an independent third-party accounting firm. See the [USDG transparency reports][transparency].
