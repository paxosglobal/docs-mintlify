title: 'Bridged Stablecoin Standard Guide'
description: This guide describes the process for third-party teams to deploy bridged forms of Paxos stablecoins on EVM blockchains using LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard, with the option for Paxos to natively issue in the future.
---
This standard leverages LayerZero's cross-chain messaging protocol and OFT contracts to enable secure, efficient bridging of Paxos stablecoins across multiple blockchain networks while maintaining the ability to transition to native issuance when appropriate.

## High Level Steps

1. Third-party team deploys the bridged Paxos stablecoin token contract following Paxos specifications. (See [Token Deployment](#token-deployment))
2. Third-party team deploys the LayerZero `OFTWrapper` contract that interfaces with the Paxos bridged token contract. (See [OFT Wrapper Implementation](#oft-wrapper-implementation))
3. Third-party team utilizes a lock/unlock adapter for the native token.
4. LayerZero endpoints handle cross-chain message passing and verification, ensuring secure token transfers between chains.
5. The [Native Token Upgrade Process](#native-token-upgrade-process) will be followed if and when a joint decision is made by the third-party team and Paxos to upgrade to native issuance.
6. The native token contract retains existing supply, holders, and bridging capabilities.

## Token Deployment

### Token Contract Requirements
Paxos stablecoins are maintained in the [paxos-token-contracts](https://github.com/paxosglobal/paxos-token-contracts)
repository. The repository contains Hardhat scripts to help with deployment. `PaxosTokenV2` leverages a separately deployed
`SupplyControl` contract to control the token supply. Deploying both contracts is required to properly manage minting and burning.

Deployed token requirements for native issuance eligibility:
1. **Implement Paxos Token Standards**: Use the official Paxos token and `SupplyControl` implementations. Deployed bytecode must match exactly (excluding metadata changes).
2. **Support Minter Pattern**: Allow the `OFTWrapper` to mint and burn tokens via `SupplyControl`.
3. **Upgradeable Contracts**: Both `PaxosTokenV2` and `SupplyControl` must be upgradeable.
4. **No Unauthorized Upgrades**: The contract should only ever be upgraded with Paxos's explicit consent. Failure to do so may make the token ineligible for the native token migration.

Deployed token recommendations:
1. **Use UUPSUpgradeable Proxy**: This proxy pattern is safer for upgrading and should be used for all new token deployments. See the [USDG contract](https://github.com/paxosglobal/paxos-token-contracts/blob/master/contracts/stablecoins/USDG.sol#L12) for usage.

### Metadata Guidelines
To avoid confusion between native and bridged stablecoins the metadata must clearly indicate that this is a bridged token
supported by a third-party team.

#### Token name
The token name should follow the format: `Bridged <existing token name> (team name)`

#### Token symbol
The token symbol should contain the existing token symbol and an appropriate prefix or suffix to distinguish it from the
native token.

#### Decimals
Must use same number of decimals as the native token.

### Role Management
All roles must be implemented.
Token contract roles:
1. **Admin**: Controls administrative functions and role assignments
2. **Asset Protection**: Manages address restrictions per Paxos requirements
3. **Pauser**: Can pause token transfers in emergencies and during the native token migration

`SupplyControl` contract roles:
1. **Admin**: Controls administrative functions and role assignments
2. **Supply Controller**: Manages minting and burning (initially the OFT wrapper)
3. **Supply Controller Manager**: Can add, update, and remove SupplyControllers

## OFTWrapper Implementation

The `OFTWrapper` serves as the connection between LayerZero's cross-chain messaging protocol and Paxos token contracts. This wrapper must implement specific functionality to support both normal operations and the eventual upgrade process. It's highly recommended to use the Paxos `OFTWrapper`
implementation found in [cross-chain-contracts](https://github.com/paxosglobal/cross-chain-contracts). The repo contains
scripts to help with deployment as well as setting up the LayerZero bridge.

Once the OFTWrapper is deployed and the bridge is wired, make sure to also grant it mint permissions in `SupplyControl` by calling `addSupplyController`.

If the third-party team wants to use a different OFT wrapper check with Paxos as this may make the token ineligible for the native token migration.

## Native Token Upgrade Process
Paxos will take ownership over the bridged token and bridge upon mutual agreement. When this happens the following will occur:
1. The bridged token on Chain B is paused and the current supply is noted.
2. The bridge is disabled by removing the current lock/unlock peer.
3. Roles are transferred to Paxos for the token, `SupplyControl`, and `OFTWrapper`.
4. Metadata is updated.
5. Paxos will burn the locked tokens on the native chain (Chain A) using the current supply from Chain B.
6. OFT peers are updated so that the `OFTWrapper` on Chain B points to the existing mint/burn `OFTWrapper` on Chain A
instead of the lock/unlock wrapper.
7. The token is now considered natively issued and is unpaused.

## Security Considerations

### Multi-Chain Security

1. **Endpoint Security**: LayerZero endpoints must be properly configured and monitored
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limits to prevent large-scale exploits
3. **Cross-Chain Verification**: Rely on LayerZero's message verification system
4. **Emergency Pause**: Maintain ability to pause bridging across all integrated chains

### Upgrade Security

1. **Token Pausing**: The token will be paused during the upgrade
2. **Supply Verification**: The bridged supply will be thoroughly audited before upgrade
3. **Role Transfer**: Roles will be validated to ensure all third-party access is revoked
4. **Burn Verification**: The burn amount will be confirmed to exactly match the bridged supply

## Implementation Checklist

Before deploying bridged Paxos stablecoins:

- Deploy token and `SupplyControl` contracts with correct parameters
- Deploy `OFTWrapper` with correct LayerZero endpoint configuration
- Grant `OFTWrapper` mint permissions on token contract
- Configure rate limits appropriate for expected volume (recommended)
- Verify LayerZero endpoint connections across all chains
- Test cross-chain transfers on testnet
- Implement monitoring for bridge operations
- Document emergency procedures
- Establish communication channels with Paxos team

## Technical Requirements

### Mainnet Deployment

1. Deployed bytecode must exactly match all audited paxos contracts
2. Deployed bytecode must exactly match testnet deployments
3. All contracts must be verified on block explorers
4. Compiler metadata must be preserved and available
5. Multisig or governance controls must be documented

## Monitoring

Teams should monitor:
- Bridge transaction volumes and patterns
- Rate limit utilization
- Failed or stuck transactions
- LayerZero endpoint health
- Token supply consistency across chains

## Notice
The Bridged Stablecoin Standard grants Paxos the option, but not the obligation, to obtain ownership of the token contract and upgrade to native issuance.
The Bridged Stablecoin Standard must be incorporated prior to deployment and cannot be retroactively applied.
The Bridged Stablecoin Standard is for informational purposes and will only apply should Paxos choose to upgrade a particular bridged stablecoin to native issuance.
The Bridged Stablecoin Standard does not constitute an offer to upgrade a particular form of bridged stablecoin.
Paxos's decision to upgrade a particular bridged stablecoin to native issuance may be subject to additional terms and conditions.
Bridged tokens are not issued by Paxos and carry additional risks related to bridge security and cross-chain operations.
