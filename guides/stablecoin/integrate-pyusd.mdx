title: 'Integrate with PYUSD on Ethereum'
description: The steps to integrate PYUSD on your platform are similar to executing smart contract functions for other ERC20 tokens.

[eip-20-standard]: https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-20.md

A minimally viable implementation of PYUSD must:

- Allow the recipient to create an Ethereum wallet address to receive PYUSD tokens.
- Monitor the PYUSD main network address for transfers to the recipient's wallet address.
- Appropriately credit the user's balance upon confirmed transfers.
- Allow the user to transfer PYUSD tokens back to Paxos and PayPal using the contract's `transfer` or `transferFrom` functions.

When using `transferFrom`, we recommend using the `increaseApproval` and `decreaseApproval` functions rather than `approve`.
This avoids a [well known attack vector][eip-20-standard] in the standard `approve` function.
