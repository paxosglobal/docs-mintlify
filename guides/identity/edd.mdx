To ensure that Paxos meets regulatory requirements, when an identity is deemed high risk according to Paxos risk rating methodology, Paxos initiates a process called Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).
This can occur during onboarding, or during the lifecycle of an active identity (for example, if identity information changes that impacts risk rating; if suspicious transaction patterns occur on the account).
When an identity enters the EDD process, Paxos requires the collection of documentary evidence supporting the initial KYC information provided.

Paxos streamlines the collection of EDD information using a webhook-based or polling-based approach, which leverages [Paxos Webhooks][webhooks], [Events API][reference] and [Document Upload API][upload].

## Webhook-based Approach

### ➊ Consume Documents Required Events

Setup a [Webhook Consumer][consumer] to receive `identity.documents_required` [events] for your end users.

### ➋ Fetch Required Documents

Call [Get Event] to fetch the event's `identity_documents_required` object, which will allow you to understand which documents are required.

### ➌ Upload the Required Documents

For the event's associated `identity_id`, call [Document Upload][upload] to upload the required documents, either synchronously if you already have the documents, or asynchronously if you need to reach back out to your customer for them to provide.

### ➍ Wait for Approval or Denial

This will be followed by an `identity.approved` or `identity.denied` event based on the onboarding decision for that end user (this might take up to 1 full business day to complete).

## Polling-based Approach

### ➊ Poll for Documents Required Events

Poll [List Events], offsetting the `created_at.gt` filter for each subsequent poll, fetching all `identity.documents_required` events.

<Info>

Paxos recommends you keep track of the [Event][events] ids you've processed in order to idempotently process the event.

### ➋ Upload the Required Documents

For the event's associated `identity_id`, call [Document Upload][upload] to upload the required documents, either synchronously if you already have the documents, or asynchronously if you need to reach back out to your customer for them to provide.
