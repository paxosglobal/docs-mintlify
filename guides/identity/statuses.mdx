## Summary Status
An [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) has five (5) statuses:

- `PENDING`: Initial state. The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) is waiting for an [Onboarding Decision](/guides/identity/statuses#onboarding-decision) and is under review.
- `APPROVED`: The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) passed internal review. It can be used with integrations, for example, creating orders.
- `DENIED`: The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) failed internal review. It cannot be used with integrations.
- `DISABLED`: The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) was `APPROVED` but has been off-boarded. It can only perform sell operations.
- `ERROR`: The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) has been frozen for compliance reasons. It cannot be used with integrations.

This status drives what actions the identity can perform across the platform according to the grid below: 

| Status   | Hold Assets | Create Buy Orders | Create Sell Orders | Execute Open Orders | Create Crypto Deposit Address | Create Crypto Withdrawal | Receive Crypto Deposits |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `PENDING`  | ❌          | ❌                | ❌                  | ❌                   | ❌                            | ❌                       | ❌                       |
| `DENIED`   | ❌          | ❌                | ❌                  | ❌                   | ❌                            | ❌                       | ❌                       |
| `APPROVED` | ✅          | ✅                | ✅                  | ✅                   | ✅                            | ✅                       | ✅                       |

| `ERROR`    | ✅          | ❌                | ❌                  | ✅                   | ❌                            | ❌                       | ❌*                      |

_*Crypto deposits received to identities in disabled or error status will be held for review._

## Sub Statuses

The following sub-statuses are returned in identity responses and can be used to help explain why an [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) is in a given summary status.

### Sanctions Verification Status (Persons & Institutions)
- **Field**: `sanctions_verification_status`
  - **`PENDING`**: Sanctions check in progress.
  - **`DENIED`**: Sanctions hit found, cannot proceed.
  - **`APPROVED`**: No sanctions hit found, cleared to proceed.
  - **`ERROR`**: Possible sanctions hit, held for manual review.

### Additional Screening Status (Persons & Institutions)
- **Field**: `additional_screening_status`
  - **`PENDING`**: Additional screening checks are in progress.
  - **`DENIED`**: Failed additional screening checks.
  - **`APPROVED`**: Passed all additional screening checks.
  - **`ERROR`**: Possible screening hit, held for manual review.

<Tip>
Additional screening includes checking for negative news or politically exposed persons, but explicitly excludes any sanctions checks (covered by the above `sanctions_verification_status`).
</Tip>

### ID Verification Status (Persons Only)
- **Field**: `id_verification_status`
  - **`PENDING`**: Verification is in progress. Checking the identity of the person.
  - **`DENIED`**: Verification failed. Unable to verify the identity of the person.
  - **`APPROVED`**: Verification successful. The identity of the person is confirmed.

<Tip>
When using passthrough IDV, the `id_verification_status` will reflect the `passthrough_verification_status` that was set. Note 
that `passthrough_verification_status` can only ever be set to a terminal IDV status of `APPROVED` or `DENIED`.
</Tip>


## Onboarding Decision
The onboarding decision is made based on the identities risk rating and the set of verifications (as exposed in sub-statuses above).
Once there is sufficient information to make a decision, the [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) will be `APPROVED` and able to trade or `DENIED` and rejected services.

In the happy path where an [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) is `LOW` risk rating and passes all verification checks, the identity will transition to `APPROVED` status.

## Identity Controls

Identity Controls provide granular control over identity permissions and are used to manage specific restrictions on identities. These controls supplement the summary status and provide more detailed control over identity operations.

### Control Types
- **`CLOSED`**: The identity is closed and cannot perform any operations
- **`FROZEN`**: The identity is temporarily frozen, typically for compliance reasons
- **`DORMANT`**: The identity is marked as inactive due to lack of activity

### Control Controllers
Controls can be managed by different entities:
- **`PAXOS`**: Controls set by Paxos for compliance or risk management
- **`CLIENT`**: Controls that can be set by API clients

### Control Reason Codes
- **`OTHER`**: General reason not covered by specific codes
- **`DORMANT`**: Identity marked dormant due to inactivity
- **`END_USER_REQUESTED`**: Control requested by the end user
- **`SANCTIONS`**: Control applied due to sanctions screening

### Client-Manageable Controls
API clients can create and delete the following control types:
- **`CLOSED`**: Close an identity permanently
- **`DORMANT`**: Mark an identity as inactive

> Use the [Identity Controls API](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/list-identity-controls) to manage identity controls programmatically.

## Identity Status Details

The new `status_details` field in identity responses provides comprehensive information about the identity's current state:

### Active Controls
Lists all currently active controls on the identity, including:
- Control ID and type
- Who set the control (Paxos or client)
- Reason code and description
- Timestamp when the control was created

### Pending Requirements
Shows what verification steps are still needed:
- **`ID_VERIFICATION`**: Identity verification in progress
- **`SANCTIONS_SCREENING`**: Sanctions check pending
- **`ADDITIONAL_SCREENING`**: PEP/Adverse media screening pending
- **`MEMBERS`**: Institution member verification pending
- **`KYC_REFRESH`**: Periodic KYC refresh required

### Failed Requirements
Indicates which verification steps have failed:
- **`ENHANCED_DUE_DILIGENCE`**: Failed enhanced due diligence
- **`RISK_AWARENESS_ASSESSMENT`**: Failed risk assessment
- **`RISK_RATING`**: Jurisdiction or risk rating issues
- **`DISABLED_MEMBERS`**: Institution has disabled members

## Impact on Identity Operations

The combination of summary status and active controls determines what operations an identity can perform. An identity with `APPROVED` status but active `FROZEN` controls will have restricted functionality similar to `ERROR` status identities.
