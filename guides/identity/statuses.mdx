## Summary Status
An [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) has five (5) statuses:

- `PENDING`: Initial state. The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) is waiting for an [Onboarding Decision](/identity/statuses#onboarding-decision) and is under review.
- `APPROVED`: The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) passed internal review. It can be used with integrations, for example, creating orders.
- `DENIED`: The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) failed internal review. It cannot be used with integrations.
- `DISABLED`: The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) was `APPROVED` but has been off-boarded. It can only perform sell operations.
- `ERROR`: The [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) has been frozen for compliance reasons. It cannot be used with integrations.

This status drives what actions the identity can perform across the platform according to the grid below: 

| Status   | Hold Assets | Create Buy Orders | Create Sell Orders | Execute Open Orders | Create Crypto Deposit Address | Create Crypto Withdrawal | Receive Crypto Deposits |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `PENDING`  | ❌          | ❌                | ❌                  | ❌                   | ❌                            | ❌                       | ❌                       |

## Sub Statuses

The following sub-statuses are returned in identity responses and can be used to help explain why an [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) is in a given summary status.

### Sanctions Verification Status (Persons & Institutions)
- **Field**: `sanctions_verification_status`
  - **`PENDING`**: Sanctions check in progress.
  - **`DENIED`**: Sanctions hit found, cannot proceed.
  - **`APPROVED`**: No sanctions hit found, cleared to proceed.
  - **`ERROR`**: Possible sanctions hit, held for manual review.

### Additional Screening Status (Persons & Institutions)
- **Field**: `additional_screening_status`
  - **`PENDING`**: Additional screening checks are in progress.
  - **`DENIED`**: Failed additional screening checks.
  - **`APPROVED`**: Passed all additional screening checks.
  - **`ERROR`**: Possible screening hit, held for manual review.

<Tip>
Additional screening includes checking for negative news or politically exposed persons, but explicitly excludes any sanctions checks (covered by the above `sanctions_verification_status`).
</Tip>

### ID Verification Status (Persons Only)
- **Field**: `id_verification_status`
  - **`PENDING`**: Verification is in progress. Checking the identity of the person.
  - **`DENIED`**: Verification failed. Unable to verify the identity of the person.
  - **`APPROVED`**: Verification successful. The identity of the person is confirmed.

<Tip>
When using passthrough IDV, the `id_verification_status` will reflect the `passthrough_verification_status` that was set. Note 
that `passthrough_verification_status` can only ever be set to a terminal IDV status of `APPROVED` or `DENIED`.
</Tip>


## Onboarding Decision
The onboarding decision is made based on the identities risk rating and the set of verifications (as exposed in sub-statuses above).
Once there is sufficient information to make a decision, the [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) will be `APPROVED` and able to trade or `DENIED` and rejected services.

In the happy path where an [Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) is `LOW`
