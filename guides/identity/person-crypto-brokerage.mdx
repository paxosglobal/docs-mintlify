This guide walks through setting up a [Fiat and Crypto Subledger][crypto-brokerage-fiat-crypto-subledger] crypto brokerage integration,
creating a Person [Identity] and a related [Account] and [Profile] to book orders using the [Order API][order-api]. First, we will
create an [Identity] to represent the user's kyc information on the Paxos Platform. Then we will create an [Account][account-api] which sets 
up the structure of the brokerage account. Then we will create a [Profile] that represents the users fiat and crypto asset holdings. Then we will integrate with the [Order][order-api] API to
set up a simple Buy, Hold and Sell integration. This guide should take around 30 minutes.

## Prerequisites
 - Sign up to the [Paxos Dashboard][dashboard-signup] in Sandbox
 - Reach out to [Support][support] to provision access to the [Identity API][identity-api]

## Authenticate in Sandbox
Create an [API Key][dashboard-create-api-key] on the Sandbox [Paxos Dashboard][dashboard-signup] with the following scopes to access the [Identity][identity-api],
[Account][account-api] and [Order][order-api] APIs needed for this guide
 - `identity:read_identity`
 - `identity:read_account`
 - `identity:write_identity`
 - `identity:write_account`
 - `funding:read_profile`
 - `funding:write_profile`
 - `exchange:read_order`
 - `exchange:write_order`


Run below to get the `access_token` from OAuth
```shell
curl --location 'https://oauth.sandbox.paxos.com/oauth2/token' \
--form grant_type=client_credentials \
--form client_id={paxos_client_id} \
--form client_secret={paxos_secret} \
--form scope='identity:read_identity identity:read_account identity:write_identity identity:write_account funding:read_profile funding:write_profile exchange:read_order exchange:write_order'
```

Confirm the response includes requisite scopes and save the `access_token` to use in the request authorization header
throughout this guide.
```json
{
 "access_token": "{access_token}",
 "expires_in": 3599,
 "scope": "identity:read_identity identity:read_account identity:write_identity identity:write_account funding:read_profile funding:write_profile exchange:read_order exchange:write_order",
 "token_type": "bearer"
}
```
<Tip>

Include the Authorization header with the bearer token on all API requests `-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"`.

## Creating a Person Identity and Account
### ➊ Creating an Identity with Passthrough Verification
To create a person identity, Paxos requires both
 - The details of the person according to the [Person Required Details Grid][identity-required-details]
 - Data on who has completed identity verification (IDV) of the person.


### Passthrough



Set `verifier_type` to `PASSTHROUGH` and then provide details about how and when IDV was conducted for this user by setting:
- `passthrough_verifier_type` - the company of the IDV provider
- `passthrough_verified_at` - when IDV was completed for the user
- `passthrough_verification_id` - external id for the IDV record in the IDV provider's system
- `passthrough_verification_status` - the current status of IDV, `APPROVED` if verified
- `passthrough_verification_fields` - the set of fields used to verify the user during IDV

All above attributes are required when `verifier_type` is set to `PASSTHROUGH`.

```shell
curl --location "https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/identity/identities" \
--request "POST" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
--data '{
    "ref_id": "{your_end_user_ref_id}",
    "person_details": {
        "verifier_type": "PASSTHROUGH",
        "passthrough_verifier_type": "JUMIO",
        "passthrough_verified_at": "2021-06-16T09:28:14Z",
        "passthrough_verification_id": "775300ef-4edb-47b9-8ec4-f45fe3cbf41f",
        "passthrough_verification_status": "APPROVED",
        "passthrough_verification_fields": ["FULL_LEGAL_NAME", "DATE_OF_BIRTH"],

        "first_name": "Billy",
        "last_name": "Duncan",
        "date_of_birth": "1960-01-01",
        "address": {
            "address1": "123 Main St",
            "city": "New York",
            "province": "NY",
            "country": "USA",
            "zip_code": "10001"
        },
        "nationality": "USA",
        "cip_id": "073-05-1120",
        "cip_id_type": "SSN",
        "cip_id_country": "USA",
        "phone_number": "+1 555 678 1234",
        "email": "example@somemail.org"
    },
    "customer_due_diligence": {
        "estimated_yearly_income": "INCOME_50K_TO_100K",
        "expected_transfer_value": "TRANSFER_VALUE_25K_TO_50K",
        "source_of_wealth": "EMPLOYMENT_INCOME",
        "employment_status": "FULL_TIME",
        "employment_industry_sector": "ARTS_ENTERTAINMENT_RECREATION"
    }
}'
```




<Warning>

The `cip_id` of an [Identity] is required to be unique. If a `409 duplicate cip_id` error occurs,
handle it by either:
 - Refusing to support crypto brokerage services for customers who have a duplicate `cip_id`
 - If they are confirmed to be the same [Identity], create a new [Account] to represent each user account.

</Warning>

Check the response to find the `identity_id` of the newly created [Identity] and notice the status of the [Identity] is `PENDING`.
Paxos will make an [Onboarding Decision][identity-onboarding-decision] and asynchronously update the status to either `DENIED` or `APPROVED`.
```json
{
    "id": "{identity_id}",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "created_at": "2021-06-16T09:28:14Z",
    "updated_at": "2021-06-16T09:28:14Z",
    "ref_id": "{your_end_user_ref_id}",
    "person_details": {
        // ...
    }
}
```

<Info>

An [Identity] might stay in `PENDING` due to being deemed high risk by Paxos. This [Identity] will be
required to undergo [Enhanced Due Diligence]. See [how to automate document collection][edd-guide] to
allow `HIGH` risk customers to onboard to Paxos.

</Info>

### ➋ Wait for the Identity to be Approved
Using the above details should result in auto-approval of the [Identity]. You can immediately call the [Get Identity] endpoint
and see the `summary_status` is `APPROVED`.
```shell
curl --location "https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/identity/identities/{identity_id}" \
--request "GET" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

<Tip>

 - If the [Identity] is stuck in `PENDING`, read the [Identity Status][identity-status] guide to help pinpoint why. If you have further questions, you can reach out to [Support][support].
 - Use a [Webhook][webhook] integration to asynchronously process [`identity.approved`][webhook-event] and [`identity.denied`][webhook-event]
events to notify users when they have been onboarded to Paxos.

</Tip>

### ➌ Creating an Account and Profile
Now we are ready to make an [Account] and [Profile] for the [Identity]. An [Account] logically relates to a user's brokerage account,
an [Identity] therefore can have one or many [Accounts][account-api].


### Single Owner Account



The `create_profile` flag must be set to `true`, this will ensure a [Profile] is created for the [Account]. This is how to
create accounts and profiles for a [Fiat and Crypto Subledger][crypto-brokerage-fiat-crypto-subledger] integration.

```shell
curl --location "https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/identity/accounts" \
--request "POST" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
--data '{
    "create_profile": true,
    "account": {
        "identity_id": "{identity_id}",
        "ref_id": "{your_account_ref}",
        "type": "BROKERAGE",
        "description": "Brokerage account for Billy Duncan"
    }
}'
```


### Joint Accounts



For accounts with more than one owner, for example a joint brokerage account, both owners are required to have an [Identity] created on the Paxos
Platform. An [Account] and [Profile] is then created for a designated primary account owner with any additional owners being set in `members` with the
`BENEFICIAL_OWNER` role.

[Identities][identity-api] can be added or removed from an [Account] after creation using the [Add Account Members] and [Remove Account Members] endpoints respectively

```shell
curl --location "https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/identity/accounts" \
--request "POST" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
--data '{
    "create_profile": true,
    "account": {
        "identity_id": "{billy_duncan_identity_id}",
        "ref_id": "{your_account_ref_id}",
        "type": "BROKERAGE",
        "description": "Brokerage account for Billy and Sarah Duncan",
        "members": [{
            "identity_id": "{sarah_duncan_identity_id}",
            "roles": ["BENEFICIAL_OWNER"]
        }]
    }
}'
```




## Booking an Order
We will use the [Order][order-api] API to create buy and sell orders. We recommend also
taking a look at the [FIX][crypto-brokerage-fix] and [WebSocket][crypto-brokerage-websocket] solutions and using the best combination of APIs
for the specific use case.

### ➊ Fund the Account
In a complete integration, follow the [Fiat Transfers Funding Flow][fiat-transfers-quickstart] guide to learn how to fund user assets using
a [Fiat Deposit][fiat-transfers-api].

For this guide, we will use the sandbox-only Test Funds feature in [Dashboard](https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com/) to fund the [Identity] with $10,000 USD. First,
navigate to the [Dashboard Landing Page](https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com/) and locate the `Fund` button
![Fund button in Dashboard](/images/identity-guide-fund-account-button.png)

Then select the [Profile] related to the [Account] created and fund for $10,000 USD
![Funding the Account](/images/identity-guide-fund-account.png)

### ➋ Creating a Order
To book an order, specify the `profile_id` which is linked to the `account_id` created above _(if one
exists, else the omnibus `profile_id`)_.


### Buy



```shell
curl --location "https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/profiles/{profile_id}/orders" \
--request "POST" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
--data '{
    "side": "BUY",
    "market": "ETHUSD",
    "type": "LIMIT",
    "price": "1814.8",
    "base_amount": "1",
    "identity_id": "{identity_id}",
    "identity_account_id": "{account_id}"
}'
```


### Sell



```shell
curl --location "https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/profiles/{profile_id}/orders" \
--request "POST" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
--data '{
    "side": "SELL",
    "market": "ETHUSD",
    "type": "LIMIT",
    "price": "1804.2",
    "base_amount": "1",
    "identity_id": "{identity_id}",
    "identity_account_id": "{account_id}"
}'
```




You can check the status of the order by calling
```shell
curl --location "https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/profiles/{profile_id}/orders/{order_id}" \
--request "GET" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

And that is it, congratulations on completing your first end-to-end crypto brokerage integration with Paxos!
