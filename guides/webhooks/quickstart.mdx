description: Create and register a webhook consumer to start receiving events.
---

This guide walks you through setting up a webhook consumer that can integrate with Paxos to receive events that occur on
the platform. Once completed you should have a webhook consumer, tested locally, and be ready to integrate and test in sandbox;
this guide should take less than an hour to complete.

## ➊ Create a Webhook Consumer
To receive Paxos events, set up your webhook consumer that receives events as an HTTP/HTTPS POST endpoint using your language and tools of choice.

  <Tab title="Go">

```go title="paxos_webhook_consumer.go"
http.HandleFunc("/webhook/paxos", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    payload, err := io.ReadAll(req.Body)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error reading request body %v\n", err)
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusServiceUnavailable)
        return
    }

    event := paxos.Event{}
    if err = json.Unmarshal(payload, &event); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error parsing webhook event: %v\n", err)
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    if event.IsTest {
        fmt.Println("Received test event, ignoring...")
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
        return
    }

    // Unmarshal the event data into an appropriate struct depending on its Type
    switch event.Type {
    case "identity.approved":
        fmt.Printf("received documents required event: %v\n, processing...", event)
        // process documents required event
    }

    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
})
```

        try {
            PaxosEvent event = objectMapper.readValue(req.getInputStream(), PaxosEvent.class);

            if (event.isTest()) {
                System.out.println("Received test event, ignoring...");
                resp.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
                return;

<Info>

We are currently working on providing client libraries for the Paxos event object. In the meantime, please directly use the definition below:

 <Tabs>
 <Tab title="Go"> 

```go title="paxos/event.go"
package paxos

type Event struct {
    ID     string    `json:"id"`
    Type   string    `json:"type"`
    Source string    `json:"source"`
    Time   time.Time `json:"time"`
    Object string    `json:"object"`
    IsTest bool      `json:"is_test"`
}
```
</Tab>

 <Tab title="Java"> 

```java title="com/paxos/PaxosEvent.java"
package com.paxos;

import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public record PaxosEvent(
    String id,
    String type,
    String source,
    LocalDateTime time,
    String object
    Boolean isTest
) {}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Info>

## ➋ Register the Webhook via Dashboard

Log in to your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.paxos.com/login) account and navigate to the Webhooks section under the Developer tab. Configure your webhook with:
 - **Endpoint URL**: Your webhook consumer endpoint URL
 - **Authentication**: Configure either API Key or OAuth authentication
   - **API Key**: Provide the API Key Header name and API Key value that Paxos will include when calling your endpoint
   - **OAuth**: Provide the OAuth endpoint URL, Client ID, and Client Secret
 - **Event Types**: Select which [event types](/api-reference/events) you would like to receive and process
 - **Rate Limit**: Set the rate limit (1-100 requests per second, default is 10 RPS)

<Info>
Paxos does not currently support consumer-side signature-verification on webhook event messages. To keep things secure,
Paxos does not include the full event object in the webhook payload and requires you to make an authenticated
request to [Get Event](/api-reference/endpoints/events/get-event) to fetch the full event object.

Paxos is working on adding signature verification support for webhook messages. This documentation will be updated once this feature is available.
</Info>

## ➌ Test the Webhook

Once your webhook is successfully created and shows an Active status in Dashboard, use the Test feature to send test events to your endpoint. For step-by-step instructions, see [Test a Webhook](/guides/dashboard/webhooks#test-a-webhook). Verify that your consumer receives and processes the events correctly.

### Webhook Payload Format

Each webhook event sent to your endpoint contains the following fields:

| Parameter | Description| Example |
| --- |---|---|
| `id` | The unique identifier of the event. This `id` can be used to fetch the full details of the event from the [Events API](/api-reference/events). | `bd019f1c-89a7-4372-9d21-eaad9280dc41` |
| `type` | The type of the event. More details about available event types can be found in the [Webhooks API Reference](/api-reference/webhooks). | `identity.approved` |
| `source` | The source of the event. This will always be `com.paxos`. | `com.paxos` |
| `time` | The time the event was created. Formatted according to RFC3339 date-time. | `2025-01-01T14:30:02Z` |
| `object` | The object type of the event. This will always be `event`. | `event` |
| `is_test` | Whether the event was a test event. Test events are only sent via the Test feature in Dashboard.  | `false` |
