description: Create and register a webhook consumer to start receiving events.
---


This guide walks you through setting up a webhook consumer that can integrate with Paxos to receive events that occur on
the platform. Once completed you should have a webhook consumer, tested locally, and be ready to integrate and test in sandbox;
this guide should take less than an hour to complete.

## ➊ Create a Webhook Consumer
To receive Paxos events, set up your webhook consumer that receives events as an HTTP/HTTPS POST endpoint using your language and tools of choice.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Go">

```go title="paxos_webhook_consumer.go"
http.HandleFunc("/webhook/paxos", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    payload, err := io.ReadAll(req.Body)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error reading request body %v\n", err)
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusServiceUnavailable)
        return
    }

    event := paxos.Event{}
    if err = json.Unmarshal(payload, &event); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error parsing webhook event: %v\n", err)
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    // Unmarshal the event data into an appropriate struct depending on its Type
    switch event.Type {
    case "identity.approved":
        fmt.Printf("received documents required event: %v\n, processing...", event)
        // process documents required event
    }
})
```
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Java">

```clike title="WebhookServlet.java"
public class WebhookServlet extends HttpServlet {

    private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

    @Override
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
        try {
            PaxosEvent event = objectMapper.readValue(req.getInputStream(), PaxosEvent.class);

            // Unmarshal the event data into an appropriate struct depending on its Type
            switch (event.type()) {
                case "identity.documents_required":
                    System.out.printf("received documents required event: %s, processing...%n", event);
                    // process documents required event
                    break;
                default:
                    System.out.printf("received unknown event type: %s%n", event.type());
                    break;
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.printf("error reading request body: %s%n", e.getMessage());
            resp.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.printf("error parsing webhook event: %s%n", e.getMessage());
            resp.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST);
        }
    }
}
```

        if event_type == 'identity.documents_required':
            print(f"received documents required event: {payload}, processing...")
            # process documents required event
        else:

        return HttpResponse(status=200)

        return HttpResponse(status=400)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"error reading request body: {e}")
        return HttpResponse(status=503)

<Info>

We are currently working on providing client libraries for the Paxos event object. In the meantime, please directly use the definition below:

 <Tabs>
 <Tab title="Go"> 

```go title="paxos/event.go"
package paxos

type Event struct {
    ID     string    `json:"id"`
    Type   string    `json:"type"`
    Source string    `json:"source"`
    Time   time.Time `json:"time"`
    Object string    `json:"object"`
}
```
</Tab>

 <Tab title="Java"> 

```java title="com/paxos/PaxosEvent.java"
package com.paxos;

import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public record PaxosEvent(
    String id,
    String type,
    String source,
    LocalDateTime time,
    String object
) {}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Info>

## ➋ Test the Consumer Locally
<Warning>
While we work on a CLI for testing your consumer locally, please directly test with the provided sample event payload below and
reach out to [Support](https://support.paxos.com) should you require any further assistance setting up your consumer.
</Warning>

The below curl command contains an example event that Paxos will send you when an identity is approved. We do not send
the whole event payload to you in the webhook message, to get the whole payload you will need to integrate with the [Events API](/api-reference/events)
to call [Get Event](/api-reference/endpoints/events/get-event) using the event ID (`id`) provided in the above payload.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/webhook/paxos \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "id": "bd019f1c-89a7-4372-9d21-eaad9280dc41",
           "type": "identity.approved",
           "source": "com.paxos",
           "time": "2025-01-07T14:30:02Z",
           "object": "event"
         }'
```

When running the above, your consumer should receive the event, printing to standard output the below message:

    received documents required event: \{bd019f1c-89a7-4372-9d21-eaad9280dc41 identity.approved com.paxos 2025-01-07 14:30:02 +0000 UTC event\}

### Webhook Payload Format

| Parameter | Description| Example |
| --- |---|---|
| `id` | The unique identifier of the event. This `id` can be used to fetch the full details of the event from the [Events API](/api-reference/events). | `bd019f1c-89a7-4372-9d21-eaad9280dc41` |
| `type` | The type of the event. More details about available event types can be found on the corresponding events page, such as [Identity Events](/api-reference/events). | `identity.disabled` |
| `source` | The source of the event. This will always be `com.paxos`. | `com.paxos` |
| `time` | The time the event was created. Formatted according to RFC3339 date-time. | `2025-01-01T14:30:02Z` |
| `object` | The object type of the event. This will always be `event`. | `event` |
## ➌ Secure the Consumer
You must secure your consumer's endpoint by authenticating using either:

- **API Key**, a secret key we will include in the header when calling your webhook consumer endpoint. You will need to let us know the API Key Header and the API Key.
- **OAuth**, we will call your OAuth client using the provided client id / key to receive credentials to call your endpoint. You will need to provide us with the OAuth endpoint URL and the Client ID and the Client Secret.

<Info>
We do not currently support consumer-side signature-verification on our webhook event messages. To keep things secure,
we therefore do not include the full event object in the webhook payload and require you to make an authenticated
request to [Get Event](/api-reference/endpoints/events/get-event) in order to fetch the full event object.
</Info>
## ➍ Register the Consumer
We're working on supporting self-service registration in [Dashboard](https://dashboard.paxos.com/login), in the meantime please contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) to initiate webhook registration.
You'll need to let us know:
 - Which [event types](/api-reference/events) you would like to receive and process
 - Your webhook consumer endpoint URL
 - The [authentication method](#secure-the-consumer) of your webhook consumer
 - The environment (Sandbox or Prod) you would like to integrate with
