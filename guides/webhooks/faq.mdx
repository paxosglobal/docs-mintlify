<Accordion title="How do I test in Sandbox?" id="testing-in-sandbox">

The easiest way to test in Sandbox, once registered, is to use the [CreateIdentity][create-identity] API to create a new identity.
If your sandbox consumer is registered and setup correctly, you should see an `identity.approved` event. Reach out to
[Support] if you do not see the message.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My consumer failed to process a message, how should I recover?" id="consumer-failed-to-process">

If your consumer failed to process a message, Paxos will attempt to retry for up to 24 hours, read the full [retry policy][retry-policy] for more information.
After this you can use the [List Events] API to fetch undelivered events and process them.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there rate limits for webhook deliveries?" id="webhook-rate-limits">

Yes, webhook invocations to your consumer endpoint are rate-limited to 10 per second by default. If you need higher throughput, please contact [Support] to discuss increasing your rate limits. For more information, see our [rate limits documentation][rate-limits].
