<Accordion title="How do I test in Sandbox?" id="testing-in-sandbox">

The easiest way to test in Sandbox, once registered, is to use the [CreateIdentity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/create-identity) API to create a new identity.
If your sandbox consumer is registered and setup correctly, you should see an `identity.approved` event. Reach out to
[Support](https://support.paxos.com) if you do not see the message.

<Accordion title="My consumer failed to process a message, how should I recover?" id="consumer-failed-to-process">

If your consumer failed to process a message, Paxos will attempt to retry for up to 24 hours, read the full [retry policy](/guides/webhooks/retries-and-limits#retry-policy) for more information.
After this you can use the [List Events](/api-reference/endpoints/events/list-events) API to fetch undelivered events and process them.

<Accordion title="Are there rate limits for webhook deliveries?" id="webhook-rate-limits">

Yes, webhook invocations to your consumer endpoint are rate-limited to 10 per second by default. If you need higher throughput, please contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) to discuss increasing your rate limits. For more information, see our [rate limits documentation](/guides/webhooks/retries-and-limits#rate-limits).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I send test events?" id="test-events">

We are in the process of rolling out self-service Webhooks, which should be live soon. Currently you are unable to send test events as Webhooks are managed for you by Paxos.
