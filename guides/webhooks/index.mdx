Paxos Webhooks allow you to register your own endpoints to receive asynchronous events driven by the Paxos Platform.
Current webhook use-cases are restricted to [Identity Events][events], with more event types to follow. To get started, you will need to:
1. Set up a [webhook consumer][consumer] for Paxos webhook events, which is an HTTP POST endpoint that accepts and processes [events].
2. Test the webhook consumer by sending a test event to your endpoint.
3. Secure the endpoint using either API key or OAuth-based authentication.
4. Contact [Support] to go through webhook registration, specifying which [events] you would like to receive and process.

For information about webhook delivery, retry policies, and rate limits, see the [Retries and Limits][retries] guide.
