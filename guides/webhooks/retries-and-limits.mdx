## Retry Policy

If your webhook consumer endpoint fails to accept a delivery or returns a retriable error status (anything other than a 2xx response), Paxos will automatically attempt to retry the webhook delivery.

### Retry Schedule

We use an exponential backoff policy with jitter (randomization to avoid retry storms) with the following schedule:
- Initial retry delay: ~5 seconds after initial failure
- Subsequent retries: Increasing intervals with exponential backoff
- Maximum retry duration: 24 hours from the time the event was first invoked

Paxos will continue retry attempts for up to **24 hours** from the initial attempt, unless delivery succeeds. After this period, no additional retry attempts will be made.

### Handling Failed Deliveries

After the 24-hour retry window has elapsed, undelivered events will not be automatically retried. To recover these undelivered events, you can:

1. Use the [List Events] API to query for events that may have failed delivery
2. Use the event IDs to fetch the full event details via the [Events API](/api-reference/events)
3. Process these events through your regular webhook handling logic

## Rate Limits

To ensure optimal performance and stability, Paxos implements rate limits on webhook deliveries:

- **Default delivery rate**: Maximum 10 webhook invocations per second per consumer endpoint

If you need higher throughput for your webhook consumer endpoint, please contact [Support] to discuss increasing your rate limits.

## Best Practices

For optimal webhook processing, we recommend:

1. **Respond quickly**: Your webhook endpoint should acknowledge receipt with a 2xx status code as quickly as possible (ideally < 500ms)
2. **Process asynchronously**: Acknowledge the webhook immediately, then process the event asynchronously in your application
3. **Implement idempotency**: Design your webhook handlers to be idempotent in case the same event is delivered multiple times
4. **Monitor delivery failures**: Implement monitoring for webhook delivery failures to detect issues early
5. **Implement backup polling**: Establish a periodic job that polls the [Events API](/api-reference/events) as a fallback mechanism for missed webhook events
