<Description description={frontMatter.description}/>

By default, each Profile owner receives an email notification when a settlement transaction is [created](/api-reference/endpoints/settlement/create-transaction) and upon each [status](status) change.
Currently, only email notifications are supported.
Websocket and desktop notifications are being considered for future releases.

> To test email notifications in Sandbox, contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) to enable notifications.

All settlement email notifications use the same template:
