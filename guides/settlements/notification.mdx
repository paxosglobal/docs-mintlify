By default, each Profile owner receives an email notification when a settlement transaction is [created][create] and upon each [status][status] change.
Currently, only email notifications are supported.
Websocket and desktop notifications are being considered for future releases.

> To test email notifications in Sandbox, contact [Support][support] to enable notifications.

All settlement email notifications use the same template:
