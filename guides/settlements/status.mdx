<Description description={frontMatter.description}/>

The [settlement workflow](/guides/settlements#workflow) includes five statuses:

- `PENDING`: Initial state of a settlement transaction upon creation by the Source Profile owner (`source_profile_id`).
- `AFFIRMED`: The settlement transaction has been approved by the Target Profile owner (`target_profile_id`) and will be eligible for settlement once within the transaction window (`settlement_window_start` â†’ `settlement_window_end`).
- `SETTLED`: The assets in the transaction have successfully been transferred.
- `EXPIRED`: The settlement transaction is no longer eligible for settlement.
- `CANCELED`: The settlement transaction was canceled by the Source Profile owner.

When a settlement transactions is [created](/api-reference/endpoints/settlement/create-transaction), it starts in `PENDING` status.
The assets do not need to be available in the Profiles at this stage.
In the `PENDING` state, two actions can be taken:
- The Source Profile owner [cancels](/api-reference/endpoints/settlement/cancel-transaction) the transaction. Status transitions to `CANCELLED`.
- The Target Profile owner [approves](/api-reference/endpoints/settlement/affirm-transaction) the transaction. Status transitions to `AFFIRMED`.

Once the required asset balances are in the respective Profiles, settlement occurs. Status transactions to `SETTLED` when complete.

  A --> | Settlement window expires | D[EXPIRED]
  A --> | Source Profile owner cancels | E[CANCELLED]

```

Transactions in the `PENDING` or `AFFIRMED` state at the end of the settlement window (`settlement_window_end`) automatically transition to `EXPIRED`.

## Find Transactions by Status

Either involved party can use [List Transactions](/api-reference/endpoints/settlement/list-transactions) to retrieve all the transactions they are counterparty to.
Use the `statuses` query parameter to filter based on status.

<Tip>

You must specify the `limit` of items per page or an error returns.

</Tip>

```shell
curl --location 'https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/settlement/transactions?statuses=PENDING&statuses=AFFIRMED&limit=2' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}'
```

Based on the request parameters, the response contains the two most recent open transactions.
