<Accordion title="Do I need to have the right amount of assets before creating the transaction?" id="assets">

No.
You can create and approve the transaction first and then deposit [assets](blockchains) when ready.
Settlement only takes place when the transaction is [affirmed](status) and all the required assets have been deposited.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I not receiving email notifications when testing in Sandbox?" id="notifications">

Notifications are off by default in Sandbox. Contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) to turn them on.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which assets are supported for Sandbox testing?" id="testing">

You can fund your Sandbox Account with the supported [assets](blockchains) or those listed in [Create Sandbox Deposit](/api-reference/endpoints/sandbox-deposits/create-sandbox-deposit).
For most setups, use the assets you can trade, transfer or withdraw for testing.
