## Fiat Deposits and Withdrawals

Paxos credits your USD wire deposit as soon as it is received by our bank. 
Domestic wire withdrawals are processed via the FedWire system and may take 1-3 business days to settle. International wire withdrawals may take 1-5 days to reach the beneficiary bank.

Paxos can accept wires from or send wires to a bank account, even if the bank account owner is not the same as the individual or institution onboarded with Paxos.
This means Paxos allows wire transfers involving third-party bank accounts, subject to applicable compliance and regulatory checks.

CUBIX USD transfers are processed 24/7; however, longer processing time may occasionally be required.
CUBIX deposits are not subject to any limits. 

<Tip>

- Deposits with missing or incorrect information will be returned.
- USD wire transfers are not processed on weekends and on US banking holidays. CUBIX transfers are processed 24/7.
