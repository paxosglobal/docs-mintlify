The Fiat Transfers workflow includes five (5) statuses:

- `PENDING`: Initial state. The [Create Fiat Account][create-fiat-account] or [Create Fiat Withdrawal][create-fiat-Withdrawal] request is under review. 
- `APPROVED`: The [Create Fiat Account][create-fiat-account] request passed internal review. Can be used for withdrawals.
- `REJECTED`: The [Create Fiat Account][create-fiat-account] request did not pass internal review. Cannot be used for withdrawals.
- `COMPLETED`: For deposits, the corresponding `profile_id` has been credited. For withdrawals, the transfer has been sent to the external bank account.
- `FAILED`: The deposit or withdrawal did not pass internal requirements.
