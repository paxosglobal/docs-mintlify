title: 'Request Signing'
description: Use JWS to add an additional layer of security to every request.
---

Request signing adds an additional layer of security to every request you send to Paxos, and can help protect your account should your Paxos API Client ID and Secret become compromised.
Once request signing is enabled on your account, Paxos rejects all unsigned requests to authenticated endpoints.

> Request signing must be activated by Paxos. Contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) to get started.

Signed requests use your own private key, similar to [mTLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) or [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication) public authentication, and then attach the signature to the request as the `Paxos-Signature HTTP header`, using the JSON Web Signature (JWS) format.

## Set Up Signed Request

To get started, you will need to have the **Client ID** and **Secret** available for constructing the payload.
Additionally, install the JOSE/JWS library in the language of your choice, for example [PyJWT](https://pypi.org/project/PyJWT/) which includes support for crypto.

> Never share your private keys with anyone, especially for Production deployments.
> Using an HSM, secrets manager, or key-management service may provide an additional layer of protection.

### ➊ Generate Key Pair

Generate the JWS signature with your private key using a combination of the base64url encoded header and payload, using either the EdDSA (ed25519) or the ES256 algorithm.

>  To use the EdDSA (ed25519) algorithm when generating key pairs, install [OpenSSL 3](https://openssl-library.org/) using the package manager of your choice.
> Older versions of OpenSSL do not support the EdDSA (ed25519) algorithm. 

To generate a new ES256 private key using the terminal:

1. Ensure OpenSSL 3 is installed:<br/>`openssl version`
1. Create a new ES256 private key in the current working directory:<br/>`openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out my-private-ec.pem`
1. Generate the public key in the current working directory:<br/>`openssl ec -in my-private-ec.pem -pubout > my-public-ec.pem`

The process for EdDSA (ed25519) keys is similar:

1. Ensure OpenSSL 3 is installed:<br/>`openssl version`
1. `openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -outform PEM -out my-private-key.pem`
1. `openssl pkey -in my-private-key.pem -pubout > my-public-key.pem`

> Never share your private keys with anyone, especially for Production deployments.
> Using an HSM, secrets manager, or key-management service may provide an additional layer of protection.

### ➋ Add Public Key to Your Paxos Account

Go to **Admin > API**  in either [Sandbox][admin-api-sandbox] or [Production][admin-api-production] and find the **API Credentials** that require request signing.

Go to ** Admin > API**  in either [Sandbox](https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com/admin/api) or [Production](https://dashboard.paxos.com/admin/api) and find the **API Credentials** that require request signing.

> Request signing must be activated by Paxos. Contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) to get started.

Scroll down and use **Edit API Credentials** to make changes.
Switch **Request Signing** to open the edit dialogue and add your _Public Key_.

Once you **Save Changes**, contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) to get started.

### ➌ Generate Signed Request

Use a JOSE/JWS library such as [PyJWT](https://pypi.org/project/PyJWT/) to generate the signature.

#### Construct Header

The header must include the following:

| Header Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **kid** | The Key ID of the configured Public Key. Retrieve from <strong>Admin > API > API Cretentials</strong>. |
| **alg** | The algorithm used to generate the Key. The value must be: EdDSA or ES256. Retrieve from <strong>Admin > API > API Cretentials</strong>. |
| **paxos.com/timestamp** | The current timestamp in UNIX time format. Signatures remain valid for 30 minutes after the specified timestamp. |
| **paxos.com/request-method** | The POST and PUT methods also require the JWS payload in the body bytes. |
| **paxos.com/request-path** | The endpoint path, including query parameters. |

Putting it together, your header should look similar to the following:

```json
{
"kid" : "5498f424-78aa-414b-a515-13929e6951db",
"alg" : "ES256",
"paxos.com/timestamp" : "1645503272",
"paxos.com/request-method" : "POST",
"paxos.com/request-path" : "/v2/transfer/deposit-addresses"
}
```
When using a `POST` or `PUT` method, include the JWS payload in the body bytes:

```json
{"profile_id":"42bb1a2e-a68e-44d7-b5f1-59ccc5c13e91","crypto_network":"ETHEREUM"}
```

#### Create Signature

Use a library such as  [PyJWT](https://pypi.org/project/PyJWT/) to generate the request signature.
First, install the library and start a new session.
For example:

```shell
pip3 install "pyjwt[crypto]" && python3
```
Then generate the JWT signature:

```py
>>> import jwt
>>> payload = b'{"profile_id":"42bb1a2e-a68e-44d7-b5f1-59ccc5c13e91","crypto_network":"ETHEREUM"}'
>>> with open('./my-private-ec.pem', 'rb') as f: key = f.read()
... 
>>> alg = "ES256" if key.find('BEGIN EC PRIVATE'.encode('ascii')) > 0 else "EdDSA"
>>> headers = {"kid": "5498f424-78aa-414b-a515-13929e6951db", "alg": alg, 
               "paxos.com/timestamp": "1645503272",
               "paxos.com/request-method" : "POST", 
               "paxos.com/request-path": "/v2/transfer/deposit-addresses"}
>>> signature = jwt.api_jws.encode(payload=payload, key=key, headers=headers,algorithm=alg)
>>> print(signature)

>>> exit()
```

### ➍ Send Signed Request

Use the generated signature to send a signed request to Paxos.
First, authenticate with the APIs.
For example:

```shell
curl https://oauth.sandbox.paxos.com/oauth2/token \
-F grant_type=client_credentials \
-F client_id={client_id} \
-F client_secret={secret} \
-F scope="transfer:write_deposit_address"
```
Then send the signed API request:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/transfer/deposit-addresses 
-H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
-H "Paxos-Signature: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjU0OThmNDI0LTc4Y

-d '{"profile_id":"42bb1a2e-a68e-44d7-b5f1-59ccc5c13e91","crypto_network":"ETHEREUM"}'
```

## Manage Signed Requests

For Production environments, you may want to create multiple API Credentials with different permissions and authentication.
For example, you may want to sign all order and identity requests but not requests for historical data.
To do this, you can create multiple API Credentials and then enable request signing for only those users or applications dealing with sensitive information.

- **Use Multiple Request Signing Keys**. It is also possible for you to simultaneously use multiple request signing keys with a single API Credential. Once you add an additional request signing key, it is immediately available for use, along with any existing key, for the API Credential. Used in this way, you can assign different request signing keys to different users or applications that use the same API Credential. This can come in handy if you need to revoke access for an application or user with a specific key: The API Credentials remain active, along with the other keys.
- **Rotate API Credentials**. If your API Credentials needs to be changed, the Rotate Credentials option regenerates a new Secret, leaving the Client ID unchanged. When you rotate credentials, you will need to update any implementation that uses the Client ID. Once that is done, your request signing keys work with the new Secret.
