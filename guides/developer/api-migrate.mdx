import { V1Migrate } from '/snippets/v1-migrate.mdx';

The Paxos v1 APIs have reached End of Life. 
Access to all Paxos v1 APIs has been removed.
This change ensures all Paxos customers are using supported APIs.

Customers should migrate remaining usage from the v1 API as all functionality is now available in [Paxos v2 APIs](/api-reference).
We recommend you test your integrations in Sandbox before applying the changes to your integration in Production.

To help with the transition, this guide provides suggestions on implementing similar functionality using the Paxos REST API (v2).

## Get Started in Sandbox

We recommend you test your integration in the Sandbox environment prior to deploying the changes in production.
If not already done so, [sign up for a Sandbox account](https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com/).
Then [configure API credentials](/guides/developer/credentials).
