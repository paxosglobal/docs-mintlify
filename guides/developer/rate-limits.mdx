description: Review REST, WebSocket and FIX limits.

Paxos implements REST and WebSocket limits to help ensure platform stability.
All integrations should observe the stated rate limits to prevent disruptions.

## REST Limits

Paxos sets rate limits per endpoint and IP address, based on the average number of requests per second during a five (5) minute window.
If you hit a rate limit on a specific endpoint, you will receive a `429` response status code. All requests from the offending IP are then throttled for five (5) minutes.

<RestLimits />

Minimally, Paxos recommends gracefully handling limits by watching for `429` status codes and building retry functionality.
The retry mechanism should include a backoff schedule that takes volume into consideration.
There are a number of open source tools available to help handle rate limits.

## WebSocket Limits

Market and execution data services have a rate limit of one (1) subscription per second from the same IP address.
If the rate limit is exceeded, no error message is sent.
Rather, each client must wait one (1) second before receiving data.
For example, if 20 new clients connect from the same IP address, it will take about 20 seconds for all the clients to receive data.

> When connecting a large number of clients, some may fail and close the connection before receiving a response from the server.

Paxos recommends all clients implement a single `wss://` connection at the server level (multiplexing).
Multiple connections can create logistical and update issues without providing appreciable performance gains.
To support integration and platform stability and maintenance, each implementation should:
- Ensure all application clients can easily rollout platform updates to users through a single mechanism.
- Have a centralized reconnection mechanism to recover from any feed disruptions.
- Have a reconnection mechanism in case of server disconnection. 
- Observe the WebSocket rate limits.

Paxos support may reach out to you if your client does not implement this guidance.

## FIX Limits

Maximum 150 messages per second, per session.
