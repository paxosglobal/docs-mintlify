title: 'Make First API Request'
description: Use the access token to retrieve a list of Profiles.
---

[access token]: /developer/authenticate#token
[adding scopes]: /developer/authenticate#scopes
[Profile]: /api-reference/profiles
[List Profiles]: /api-reference/profiles/list-profiles
[credentials]: /developer/credentials
[authentication]: /developer/authenticate
[Support]: https://support.paxos.com

Since every account has a `DEFAULT` [Profile], sending a request using [List Profiles] will always return a result, assuming the `funding:read_profile` scope was included when [adding scopes] to the client.
Include the [access token] from the authentication request in the authorization header.
### Sandbox

```shell  highlight={3}
curl --location 'https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/profiles?order=ASC&order_by=CREATED_AT' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}'
```
### Production

```shell   highlight={3}
curl --location 'https://api.paxos.com/v2/profiles?order=ASC&order_by=CREATED_AT' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}'
```
A successful response includes all Profiles the client has access to.
Using the `?order=ASC&order_by=CREATED_AT` parameters ensures the `DEFAULT` Profile is first in the list.

```json highlight={3-7}
{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "0d3172c5-8840-4bae-bdd4-30688f0268fc",
            "nickname": "default",
            "type": "DEFAULT"
        },
        {
            "id": "7437da4d-c114-4a1f-8659-ceeaf868a1eb",
            "nickname": "Mint",
            "type": "NORMAL"
        },
        {
            "id": "4bdfed80-ed0d-461b-bfee-0ff5011a9db5",
            "nickname": "Redeem",
            "type": "NORMAL"
        },
    ]
}

```

If you get an error, run through the [credentials] and [authentication] guides and ensure your setup is correct.
If things are still not working, contact [Support].
