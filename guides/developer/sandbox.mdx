description: Use the Sandbox environment to mock flows, execute transfers and test integrations.

The Developer Sandbox replicates core [v2 API](/api-reference) functionality with an automated system that uses test fund to simulate normal activities, including a few Sandbox-only endpoints.

> To start using the Sandbox environment, [create a Developer account](https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com/).

## Sandbox Testnets and Devnets

When you use [Create Sandbox Deposit](/api-reference/endpoints/sandbox-deposits/create-sandbox-deposit) to fund a Profile, the platform creates the asset on the testing network.
The asset can then be [transferred](/api-reference/endpoints/crypto-withdrawals/create-crypto-withdrawal) to any off-platform address that supports the test network.
Similarly, when using [create a deposit address](/api-reference/endpoints/deposit-addresses/create-deposit-address) in Sandbox, the generated address can be used to transfer test assets to the Paxos platform.

| Crypto Network | Supported Testnet/Devnet |
| --- | --- |
| Arbitrum One | Sepolia |
| Bitcoin | Testnet3 |
| Bitcoin Cash | Testnet |
| Ethereum | Sepolia |
| Litecoin | Testnet |
| Polygon POS | Sepolia |
| Solana | Devnet |

## Sandbox Identity Testing

When testing the [Identity APIs](/api-reference/endpoints/identity) in Sandbox, you may be blocked by a verification process.
If this is the case, use [Sandbox Set Identity Status](/api-reference/endpoints/sandbox-identity/sandbox-set-identity-status) to change `id_verification_status` and `sanctions_verification_status` to \"APPROVED"`and enable an individual identity to transact during Sandbox testing.
To enable the Institution to transact during Sandbox testing, set `sanctions_verification_status` to \"APPROVED"`.

## Sandbox Fiat Transfer Testing

To test [Fiat Transfers API](/api-reference/endpoints/fiat-transfers) in Sandbox, the [Initiate Sandbox Fiat Deposit](/api-reference/endpoints/sandbox-fiat-transfers) endpoint starts test fiat deposit that will be processed based on the `memo_id` from a previous [Fiat Deposit Instructions](/api-reference/endpoints/fiat-transfers/list-fiat-deposit-instructions) response.
Learn more in the [Fiat Transfer Guide](/guides/developer/fiat-transfers/quickstart#2-send-fiat-to-paxos).

> When [creating API credentials](/guides/developer/credentials) via the Dashboard, the `transfer:write_sandbox_fiat_deposit` scope may not appear in the UI.
> Including the scope when [authenticating](/guides/developer/authenticate) may result in an `invalid_scope` error.
> Contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) if you run into any issues using this scope.
