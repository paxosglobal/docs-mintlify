The Developer Sandbox replicates core [v2 API][v2-api] functionality with an automated system that uses test fund to simulate normal activities, including a few Sandbox-only endpoints.

> To start using the Sandbox environment, [create a Developer account][sandbox-account].

## Sandbox Testnets and Devnets

When you use [Create Sandbox Deposit][create-sandbox-deposit] to fund a Profile, the platform creates the asset on the testing network.
The asset can then be [transferred][crypto-withdrawal] to any off-platform address that supports the test network.
Similarly, when using [create a deposit address][create-deposit-address] in Sandbox, the generated address can be used to transfer test assets to the Paxos platform.

| Crypto Network | Supported Testnet/Devnet |
| --- | --- |
| Arbitrum One | Sepolia |
| Bitcoin | Testnet3 |
| Bitcoin Cash | Testnet |
| Ethereum | Sepolia |
| Litecoin | Testnet |
| Polygon POS | Sepolia |
| Solana | Devnet |

## Sandbox Identity Testing

When testing the [Identity APIs][identity] in Sandbox, you may be blocked by a verification process.
If this is the case, use [Sandbox Set Identity Status][sandbox-identity] to change `id_verification_status` and `sanctions_verification_status` to \"APPROVED"`and enable an individual identity to transact during Sandbox testing.
To enable the Institution to transact during Sandbox testing, set `sanctions_verification_status` to \"APPROVED"`.

## Sandbox Fiat Transfer Testing

To test [Fiat Transfers API][fiat] in Sandbox, the [Initiate Sandbox Fiat Deposit][sandbox-fiat] endpoint starts test fiat deposit that will be processed based on the `memo_id` from a previous [Fiat Deposit Instructions][fiat-instructions] response.
Learn more in the [Fiat Transfer Guide][fiat-guide].

> When [creating API credentials][credentials] via the Dashboard, the `transfer:write_sandbox_fiat_deposit` scope may not appear in the UI.
> Including the scope when [authenticating][authenticate] may result in an `invalid_scope` error.
> Contact [Support] if you run into any issues using this scope.
