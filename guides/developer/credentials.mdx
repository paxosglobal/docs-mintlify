1. Go to **Admin > API Management** to add new credentials.<br/><br/><CredentialsLoginNote />
1. Create a **Label** for your API credentials and select the **Scopes** for your **Client ID**. For example, the following scopes (space delimited) should be adequate to [mint], [redeem] and [convert] Paxos-issued stablecoins:<br/><br/> 
    <Scopes />
1. Save the credentials.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and store them in a safe place. The secret will not be displayed in the UI again and will have to be reset if forgotten.

Once you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, you can [authenticate in Sandbox].
