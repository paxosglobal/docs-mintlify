The Paxos documentation is optimized for AI-assisted development through comprehensive resources that provide contextually-aware help with your integration.

## Documentation Resources

### llms.txt File

The `llms.txt` file is an industry standard that helps AI tools index content more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines. It provides a structured overview of all available documentation pages.

<PreviewButton href="/llms.txt">Open the llms.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

### Complete Documentation Compilation

The `llms-full.txt` file combines the entire documentation site into a single file as context for AI tools. You can paste a single URL as context for AI tools for more relevant and accurate responses.

## API Specification

Our OpenAPI specification provides detailed API endpoints, request/response schemas, and error messages to ensure accurate implementation. This is particularly valuable for understanding exact API requirements and handling error cases properly.

## Best Practices

When working with AI coding assistants:

1. **Reference the llms-full.txt** for comprehensive context about Paxos APIs and integration patterns
2. **Use the OpenAPI spec** for precise API implementation details
3. **Include specific error handling** based on documented error responses
4. **Follow authentication patterns** outlined in the developer guides

> Both documentation files are always up to date and require zero maintenance.
