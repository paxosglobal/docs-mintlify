The assets and crypto networks listed on this page are fully supported on the Paxos Platform.
These assets are supported in the context of three main use cases:

- Deposit and withdraw USD via Fedwire, SWIFT and CUBIX. Get started with [fiat transfers](/guides/developer/fiat-transfers).
- Use stablecoins for [deposits](/api-reference/endpoints/deposit-addresses), [withdrawals](/api-reference/endpoints/crypto-withdrawals) and [transfers](/api-reference/endpoints/transfers). Learn more about stablecoin [conversions](/guides/developer/convert) and [payments](payments).
- The crypto trading assets are primarily available for [Crypto Brokerage](https://paxos.com/crypto-brokerage/) partners to buy, sell deposit and withdraw via APIs, in addition to holding the assets on the Paxos platform. Trading pairs that incorporate USD are also available in [USDP](/guides/stablecoin/usdp) and [PYUSD](/guides/stablecoin/pyusd). Read the [orders reference docs](/api-reference/endpoints/orders) and the [HRQ guide](/guides/crypto-brokerage/quotes/index).
