## Understanding Orchestrations

Orchestrations allow customers to perform complex actions by executing multi-step
workflows to move between assets, networks, and rails. There are two types of Orchestrations
ad-hoc, and rule-based. Rule-based orchestrations are based off a rule which is triggered
upon deposit to a crypto address or a bank account. Ad-hoc orchestrations are one-off
orchestrations that can be triggered to move funds from a profile to a number of destinations.

As we'll show in the [mint](), [convert](), and [redeem]() pages these orchestrations can
be harnessed to perform a number of operations.

## Orchestration Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates all possible orchestration routes within the Paxos platform:

### Key Points

- **Rule-based Orchestrations**: Originate from external fiat deposits (bank accounts) or external crypto deposits (blockchain). These trigger automatically when a matching rule exists.
- **Ad-hoc Orchestrations**: Must originate from internal profiles but can route to profiles, external fiat accounts, or external crypto addresses.
- **Profile-to-Profile Transfers**: Customers with multiple internal profiles can execute ad-hoc transfers between them.
- **Asset Conversion**: Any transfer can involve different source and destination assets (not shown for clarity but applies to all routes).
