To access the Dashboard, your [Entity Manager](/guides/dashboard/roles#entity-manager) will either invite you to register for a [passkey-based sign in](/guides/dashboard/admin/team#passkey-based-login) or enable access through your company's [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/guides/dashboard/admin/team#sso-based-login).

If you're unable to sign in or unsure which login method to use, contact your [Entity Manager](/guides/dashboard/roles#entity-manager) or IT team for help.
