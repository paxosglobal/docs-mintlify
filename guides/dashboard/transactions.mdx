## Travel Rule Actions

The Paxos platform supports [Travel Rule] to ensure regulatory compliance within certain geographies.
If any of your transactions are missing information due to Travel Rule requirements, you'll see a **Requiring Action** section at the top of the [Transactions] page.
This section includes all transactions that need attention and action.
