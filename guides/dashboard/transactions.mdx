Go to [Transactions](https://dashboard.paxos.com/dashboard/transactions) to track and review current and past activity.
Select either [Asset Movements](https://dashboard.paxos.com/dashboard/transactions/asset-movements) to see deposits and transfers or [Conversions](https://dashboard.paxos.com/dashboard/transactions/conversions) to review assets that have been converted and moved to another [Profile](/guides/dashboard/organization#profile) within the same [Entity](/guides/dashboard/organization#entity).
A list of recent transactions is available for offline viewing using **Export**.

> When contacting [Support](https://support.paxos.com) about a transfer, include the unique **Transfer ID** and **Group ID** in your message to help our agents find the correct transaction.

## Travel Rule Actions

The Paxos platform supports [Travel Rule](/guides/dashboard/travel-rule) to ensure regulatory compliance within certain geographies.
If any of your transactions are missing information due to Travel Rule requirements, you'll see a **Requiring Action** section at the top of the [Transactions](https://dashboard.paxos.com/dashboard/transactions) page.
This section includes all transactions that need attention and action.
