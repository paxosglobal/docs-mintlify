Go to [Transactions] to track and review current and past activity.
Select either [Asset Movements] to see deposits and transfers or [Conversions] to review assets that have been converted and moved to another [Profile] within the same [Entity].
A list of recent transactions is available for offline viewing using **Export**.

> When contacting [Support] about a transfer, include the unique **Transfer ID** and **Group ID** in your message to help our agents find the correct transaction.

## Travel Rule Actions

The Paxos platform supports [Travel Rule] to ensure regulatory compliance within certain geographies.
If any of your transactions are missing information due to Travel Rule requirements, you'll see a **Requiring Action** section at the top of the [Transactions] page.
This section includes all transactions that need attention and action.
