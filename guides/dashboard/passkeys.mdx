Passkeys provide a secure and easier way to sign in to the Paxos Dashboard.
With [passkeys][passkey], there are no passwords to remember and no two-factor authentication.
Under the covers, when you add a passkey you are creating cryptographic key pairs for Paxos Dashboard: one key is stored on the Paxos server and the other is stored in your [password manager](#recommended-managers) or on your device.
When you [sign in with a passkey][sign-in], the Paxos server ensures you are using the correct passkey.

There are numerous ways to use passkeys; however, we recommend using a [password manager](#recommended-managers) that can sync across multiple devices for the most portable experience.

## Recommended: Use a Password Manager

We recommend saving and using passkeys with the following password managers in conjunction with a [compatible browser](#passkey-browsers).
Third-party password managers may require you to create an account and install additional browser plugins/extensions.
Check with your IT organization if you have any questions about password managers.

- [Google Password Manager][google-chrome]
- [1Password][1password]
- [Proton Pass][proton] 

If you can't use any of the recommended password managers, use a password manager that allows for passkey synchronization across devices.
