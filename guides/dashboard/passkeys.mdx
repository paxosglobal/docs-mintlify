Passkeys provide a secure and easier way to sign in to the Paxos Dashboard.
With [passkeys](https://passkey.org/), there are no passwords to remember and no two-factor authentication.
Under the covers, when you add a passkey you are creating cryptographic key pairs for Paxos Dashboard: one key is stored on the Paxos server and the other is stored in your [password manager](#recommended-managers) or on your device.
When you [sign in with a passkey](/guides/dashboard/signin#passkey), the Paxos server ensures you are using the correct passkey.

There are numerous ways to use passkeys; however, we recommend using a [password manager](#recommended-managers) that can sync across multiple devices for the most portable experience.

## Recommended: Use a Password Manager

We recommend saving and using passkeys with the following password managers in conjunction with a [compatible browser](#passkey-browsers).
Third-party password managers may require you to create an account and install additional browser plugins/extensions.
Check with your IT organization if you have any questions about password managers.

- [Google Password Manager](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/13168025)
- [1Password](https://support.1password.com/save-use-passkeys/)
- [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/support/pass-use-passkeys) 

If you can't use any of the recommended password managers, use a password manager that allows for passkey synchronization across devices.
