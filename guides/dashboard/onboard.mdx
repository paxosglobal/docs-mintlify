## ID Verification

When the supporting documents are accepted, the final step is to provide individual identify information, which usually consists of providing a government issued ID such as passport, national ID card or driver license and taking a real-time "selfie" photo of you holding your ID.
To avoid common errors with the ID verification process:

- Ensure your webcam is enabled in the browser.
- Before uploading the ID, ensure all four corners of your ID document are visible, the text is clear and legible, and that the ID is not expired.
- Do not use a professional headshot for the real-time "selfie" photo. Take your "selfie" photo while holding your ID document at or near the time of onboarding.
