Paxos collects identifying information to ensure your [Entity](/guides/dashboard/organization#organization) complies with all regulations and requirements for the jurisdictions your business operates in. This involves entering business details, uploading organizational documents, and verifying IDs. 

The process takes about ~15 minutes if you have everything ready, and Paxos may request additional information during review. 

<Note>
Depending on your business structure and operating jurisdiction, the review process can take anywhere from a day to weeks.

## 3. Review and Accept Terms

Review and accept all applicable terms and conditions, pricing and fee information before reviewing and accepting the entity onboarding information you provided.

## 4. Upload Documents

Before you can complete onboarding, provide Paxos with supporting documents for your organization.
You an upload the documents in the web application.
The list below can be used as a general guide for most institutions.
Paxos may reach out to you for additional documentation as needed.

## 5. Verify ID 

When the supporting documents are accepted, the final step is to provide individual identify information, which usually consists of providing a government issued ID such as passport, national ID card or driver license and taking a real-time "selfie" photo of you holding your ID.

<Tip>
**Tips to avoid common errors during ID verification:**

- Make sure your webcam is enabled in your browser.
- When uploading your ID, ensure all four corners are visible, the text is clear and legible, and the ID is not expired.
- For the real-time "selfie" photo, do not use a professional headshot. Take a new photo of yourself holding your ID document at or near the time of onboarding.
