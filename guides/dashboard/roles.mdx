Paxos offers a granular access management system that allows you to customize the level at which you control access to various Dashboard actions. Users looking for basic functionality have access to pre-defined Paxos Managed roles made up of a set of permissions. For more flexibility, create your own Custom Roles to combine permissions into new roles with more granular scopes. 

All roles and associated permissions are scoped at an Entity level.

## Organization Administrator

All Organizations have at least one Organization Administrator with permission to onboard Entities.
Organization Administrators who complete the onboarding for an Entity automatically become the [Entity Manager](#entity-manager) for that Entity.

## Entity Manager

Entity Managers assign roles, add users, map identity provider groups to roles, etc.
Entity Managers can [review Entity specific settings](https://dashboard.paxos.com/admin).
Entity Managers can be reassigned once an Entity has been created.
Entity Managers have view permissions across the Dashboard, but cannot perform treasury focused actions.

> Use the Entity ID on the [ Admin > Entity Settings](https://dashboard.paxos.com/admin) when contacting [Support](https://support.paxos.com).

## Treasurer

The Treasurer role enables users to:

- Create Profiles and update balances.
- Deposit, transfer and withdrawal supported assets.
- Mint, convert and redeem Paxos-issued stablecoins.
- View reports.

## Approver

The Approver can approve or reject any submitted action that requires [Approvals](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/admin/approvals). 

## Developer

The Developer can view, create, update and delete [API credentials](https://dashboard.paxos.com/admin/api).

## Viewer

A Viewer has read-only access to view user roles and permissions, cash and crypto balances, deposit and transfer details, API keys, reports as well as conversion information.

### Custom Roles

Custom roles enable organizations to define granular access control for users by specifying a tailored set of permissions and actions beyond the above predefined role templates.
