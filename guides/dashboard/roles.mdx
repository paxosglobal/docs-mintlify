title: 'Roles and Responsibilities'
description: Learn more about the default roles for your Entity.
---


The Dashboard includes a default set or associated roles and permissions that the [Entity Manager](#entity-manager) provisions before using the Dashboard.
These roles and associated permissions are bound to the Entity, so it is possible to have different roles depending on an individual's Entity-specific responsibilities.

</Tip>

## Organization Administrator

All Organizations have at least one Organization Administrator with permission to onboard Entities.
Organization Administrators who complete the onboarding for an Entity automatically become the [Entity Manager](#entity-manager) for that Entity.

## Entity Manager

Entity Managers assign roles, add users, map identity provider groups to roles, etc.
Entity Managers can [review Entity specific settings](https://dashboard.paxos.com/admin).
Entity Managers can be reassigned once an Entity has been created.
Entity Managers have view permissions across the Dashboard, but cannot perform treasury focused actions.

> Use the Entity ID on the [ Admin > Entity Settings](https://dashboard.paxos.com/admin) when contacting [Support].

## Treasurer

The Treasurer role enables users to:

- Create Profiles and update balances.
- Deposit, transfer and withdrawal supported assets.
- Mint, convert and redeem Paxos-issued stablecoins.
- View reports.

## Approver

The Approver can approve or reject any submitted action that requires [Approvals](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/admin/approvals). 

## Developer

The Developer can view, create, update and delete [API credentials](https://dashboard.paxos.com/admin/api).

## Viewer

A Viewer has read-only access to view user roles and permissions, cash and crypto balances, deposit and transfer details, API keys, reports as well as conversion information.
