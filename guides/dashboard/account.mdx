When you sign up for an account, you create an [Organization][org], which is not tied to any specific region or jurisdiction.
Once the account (Organization) is approved, you then need to complete [onboarding][kyc] for the different jurisdictions your business operates in.

To create an account you will need an email address, as well as the business name and country of incorporation.
Account applications are usually reviewed in less than one business day and take under an hour to create and [onboard][kyc].

Before you begin, ensure you are able to create and store a [passkey] on your device.
All modern [operating systems and browsers][compatible-devices] support passkeys.

1. Go to https://dashboard.paxos.com, select **Sign Up** and provide a name and email address to create an _Institutional (Business) account_. Individual account holders are not eligible for Dashboard accounts.
The [organization name][org] should represent the parent company, if one exists. For example, if **My Company** is comprised of three separate legal [entities][entity], **My Company Asia**, **My Company Europe** and **My Company North America**, using **My Company** as the organization will enable you to onboard the entities, using the legal business names, within the same organization bucket.
1. Retrieve the verification code from the welcome email from Paxos and enter the code in the browser. If you don't get an email within a few minutes, check email filters and Spam/Junk folders for an email from `@paxos.com`. Contact [Support] if the email never arrives.
1. Create a passkey.<PasskeyNote />
1. Provide basic business information. The **Country of Incorporation** and **What do you plan to use your account for?** fields determine which assets you will have access to.
1. Activate the account by completing the [Paxos KYC onboarding process][kyc].
