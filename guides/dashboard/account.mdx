When you sign up for an account, you create an [Organization](/guides/dashboard/organization#organization), which is not tied to any specific region or jurisdiction.
Once the account (Organization) is approved, you then need to complete [onboarding](/guides/dashboard/onboard) for the different jurisdictions your business operates in.

</Tip>

Follow these steps on the sign-up page:

1. **Enter your email**  
   Provide your email address. This will become the primary contact ([Organization Admin](/guides/dashboard/roles)) for your Organization.

2. **Create a Passkey**
   [Passkeys](/guides/dashboard/passkeys) are a more secure and accessible alternative to usernames and passwords. Learn more about compatibility and browser requirements [here](/guides/dashboard/passkeys)

3. **Provide basic business information**  
   Supply details about your use case and your business.  

<Info>

The Country of Incorporation and the 'What do you plan to use your account for?' fields determine which assets & product flows you can access. Contact us [here](https://support.paxos.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you are not sure about what to pick. 

</Info>

Once you complete these steps and register your Organization, you can start [onboarding](/guides/dashboard/onboard) to create and activate your first business entity.

<Tip>

Looking to add additional users or entities?

Once your Entity is active, the Organization Admin automatically becomes the Entity Manager for that Entity. They can invite additional users with different Roles.
