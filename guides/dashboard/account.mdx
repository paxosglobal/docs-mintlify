<Note>
  When you sign up for an account, you create an [Organization](/guides/dashboard/organization), which is not tied to any specific region or jurisdiction. Once the account (Organization) is approved, you then need to complete [onboarding](/guides/dashboard/onboard) for the different jurisdictions your business operates in.
</Note>

Follow these steps on the [sign-up page](https://dashboard.paxos.com/signup):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your work email">
    ![Dashboard Sign Up Enter Email Pn](/images/dashboard-sign-up-enter-email.png)

    This email will become the primary contact for your organization and assign you as the [Organization Admin](/guides/dashboard/roles).

<Info>
  The Country of Incorporation and the 'What do you plan to use your account for?' fields determine which assets & product flows you can access. Contact us [here](https://support.paxos.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you are not sure about what to pick.
</Info>

Once you complete these steps and register your Organization, you can start [onboarding](/guides/dashboard/onboard) to create and activate your first business entity.

  Looking to add additional users or entities?

  Once your Entity is active, the Organization Admin automatically becomes the Entity Manager for that Entity. They can invite additional users with different Roles.
