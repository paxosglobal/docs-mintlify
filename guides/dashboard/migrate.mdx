 ARCHIVED CONTENT

If you have not started the Dashboard migration, see [Migrate to the Dashboard](dashboard/migrate-to-dashboard.mdx) for instructions on the **automated** migration process.

This article applies only to those that have already started the **manual** migration process outlined below.

</Warning>

The Paxos Dashboard comes with more self-serviceability, new stablecoin orchestration [mint], [convert] and [redeem] flows, the ability to [collaborate] with more users from your organization, and [enterprise-grade access controls][team]. 

> The Dashboard is available to all existing **institutional** account holders. Individual account holders continue to use the [Wallet UI].
> Once the new account is created, institutional users will see all available balances and transactions in both the Dashboard and the Wallet UI until the organization is ready to switch.

## ➊ Create New Institutional Account

[Sign up][sign-up] for a new Dashboard institutional account.
Use your personal work email address instead of a group email address.
Register the passkey we send to your email address and [sign in][sign-up].
Learn more about [creating an account][sign-up-docs].

<PasskeyNote />

## ➋ Create a new Organization

When prompted to create a new [Organization], provide your Institution information and click **Finish**.
You do not need to onboard again.

## ➌ Contact Support

Using the email address you used when creating the new Organization, open a [Support ticket][support].
If you have more than one existing Wallet UI account, let us know the email address associated with each account.
Paxos will use this information to create separate [entities] as needed.

## ➍ Next Steps

Once Paxos receives your support ticket, [Support](https://support.paxos.com/hc/en-us) will contact you to guide you through the migration process.
