Use [Addresses](https://dashboard.paxos.com/dashboard/addresses) to review all the current destination wallet addresses that can be used to move digital assets off the Paxos platform.
For example, when [transferring a stablecoin to an external wallet](/guides/dashboard/transfer#transfer-to-an-external-wallet-or-bank-account), the options are populated from the addresses shown and configured here.

<Permissions value="view saved crypto addresses" />

To view a saved network address:

- Use the copy function in the **Address** column to quickly add an address to the clipboard.
- Use the **Actions** menu to view a saved address and review existing information, including the [beneficiary details](/guides/dashboard/travel-rule).

## Add Network Address

<AddCryptoAddress />

Optionally, perform a test [transfer](/guides/dashboard/transfer#transfer-to-an-external-wallet-or-bank-account) to ensure you can send assets to the destination wallet address.

## Delete Network Address

On the [Addresses](https://dashboard.paxos.com/dashboard/addresses) screen, use **Delete** in the **Actions** menu to permanently remove a saved network address.
Any future withdrawals to the address will fail unless you add the address again.
