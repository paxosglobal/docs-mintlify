We are rolling out the Paxos Dashboard to more institutional account holders!
When you see a banner invite in the [Wallet UI], your organization is eligible to start using the Dashboard.

<Tip>

 Have an individual account?

Use the [Wallet UI].

</Tip>

Migrating to the Dashboard takes a few minutes, and requires verifying your email address and creating a [passkey].

<PasskeyNote />

Until your organization is ready to switch, all balances and transactions are available in both the Dashboard and the [Wallet UI].

## ➊  Sign In to the Wallet UI

Go to https://account.paxos.com/login and sign in to the Wallet UI.
**_Do not create a new Dashboard account_**.

## Next Steps

Once migrated, start exploring the Dashboard's new features and improved workflows.
The [Dashboard] comes with more self-serviceability, new stablecoin orchestration [mint], [convert] and [redeem] flows, the ability to collaborate with more users from your organization, and [enterprise-grade access controls](/guides/dashboard/admin/team).
