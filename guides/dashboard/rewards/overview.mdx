## How it works

USDG rewards are based on the on-chain activity attributed to the monitoring addresses attributed to your organization. Paxos calculates rewards based on daily snapshots (taken at 23:59 +0 UTC), and distributes payouts once per month.
With our self-serve rewards product, you can:

- Add or update monitoring addresses at any time
- Set and update payout address
- View your rewards payouts

## Key Rewards Concepts

### Monitoring Address

A blockchain address that Paxos monitors on a daily basis to calculate your stablecoin rewards based on eligible on-chain activity. In order to receive rewards for using USDG, you must [register at least one monitoring address](.) that will hold, mint, or accept USDG on-chain. Examples of types of monitoring addresses you may want to add include:

- Omnibus wallet addresses for your exchange
- Dedicated wallets for your institutional custody business
- Payment addresses your organization uses to accept payments for goods/services

<Warning>
End user self-custodial wallets are not yet supported. If you need to add self-custodial wallets for your end users, please reach out to your account contact or support@paxos.com. 
</Warning>

### Payout Address

A blockchain address that Paxos will send your monthly USDG rewards to on-chain. You can select a payout address from any withdrawal address added to your Paxos organization.

### Statements & Payouts

Monthly rewards statements are shared by email. Payouts occur on a fixed schedule, one time per month.

#### Reward Payout Timeline

| Time | Example Date | Event |
| --- | --- | -- |
| T  | May 31, 2025 | Last day to add monitoring addresses for current month |
| T+20 | June 20, 2025  | Rewards statement emailed to your team (will be available in the Dashboard and via API soon) |
| T+25 | June 25, 2025  | Deadline to report any issues with your rewards statement |
| T+30 | June 30, 2025  | USDG rewards paid to your configured payout address |

<Warning>
Monitoring addresses must be added by month end (23:59 UTC+0) in order to earn rewards for that month. Addresses added after month end will start earning rewards for the following month.
