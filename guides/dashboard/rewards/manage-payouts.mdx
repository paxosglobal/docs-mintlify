### What is a payout address?

Your **payout address** is the address where Paxos will send your monthly USDG rewards. You must select one existing [withdrawal address](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/addresses) to designate as a payout address. Ethereum and Solana networks are currently the only networks supported for payouts. 

<Warning>
You must set a payout address by month end in order to receive rewards. If you do not set a payout address before month end, your rewards will be deferred until the following month. 
</Warning>

### Set or update your payout address
