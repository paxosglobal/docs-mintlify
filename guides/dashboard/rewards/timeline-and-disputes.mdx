Paxos uses a fixed rewards timeline each month:

| Milestone | Example Dates | What happens |
| --- | --- | -- |
| Calendar Month  |  May 1 - May 30 | - Paxos takes daily snapshots of on-chain activity for all your monitoring addresses. - Monitoring addresses added on during the month will be eligible to earn rewards.  |
| T (end of month) | June 1 at 00:00 UTC+0 | - Cutoff for adding new monitoring addresses. - Monitoring addresses added this date will NOT earn rewards for the prior month (i.e. wallets added on June 1 will not result in any reward payouts for May)|
| T+20 | June 20 | Rewards statement emailed to your team |
| T+25 | June 25 | Deadline to raise any issues or disputes with your reward statement |
| T+30 | June 30 | USDG rewards paid to your payout address |
