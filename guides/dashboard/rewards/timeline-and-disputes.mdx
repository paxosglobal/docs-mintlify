Paxos uses a fixed rewards timeline each month:

| Milestone | Example Dates | What happens |
| --- | --- | -- |
| Calendar Month  |  May 1 - May 30 | - Paxos takes daily snapshots of on-chain activity for all your monitoring addresses. - Monitoring addresses added on during the month will be eligible to earn rewards.  |
| T (end of month) | June 1 at 00:00 UTC+0 | - Cutoff for adding new monitoring addresses. - Monitoring addresses added this date will NOT earn rewards for the prior month (i.e. wallets added on June 1 will not result in any reward payouts for May)|
| T+20 | June 20 | Rewards statement emailed to your team |
| T+25 | June 25 | Deadline to raise any issues or disputes with your reward statement |
| T+30 | June 30 | USDG rewards paid to your payout address |

## What to do
**Before Month End (T):**
Add or confirm monitoring addresses
**T+20 → T+25:**
- Review statement
- Raise any issues or disputes to Paxos

** Before T+30:**

## Reviewing your rewards statement
Statements include:
Total amount of rewards earned
Your designated payout address

Statements are **emailed** to you on the 20th each month.

3. Fill in details (address, dates, issue)
4. Submit between T+20 and T+25
