## What is a monitoring address?

A **monitoring address** is a blockchain address that Paxos monitors daily for eligible activity tied to the Global Dollar Network. We recommend adding any addresses you expect to hold, receive, or mint USDG as a monitoring address in order to receive rewards for all of your USDG on-chain activity. 

<Warning>
Monitoring addresses must be added by month end (23:59 UTC+0) in order to earn rewards for that month. Addresses added after month end will start earning rewards for the following month.
</Warning>

## Add a monitoring address

1. Go to the **Rewards** tab in the Paxos Dashboard
2. Click **Add Monitoring Address**
3. Enter:

- Network
- Address
- (Optional) Nickname

4. Click **Submit**

Once you submit monitoring addresses, Paxos will validate that the format of the address is valid for a chosen network. Invalid addresses will be individually flagged and must be resolved or removed before you can upload a batch of monitoring addresses. 
Paxos validates addresses using the following address format standards:

- EVM: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#account-creation  
- Solana: https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts#account 

<Warning>
For Solana, derived addresses (such as ATA’s) are NOT supported. Paxos derives the token accounts associated with your standard Solana wallet addresses. If you are a more advanced user and need support for derived addresses, please email gdn-rewards@paxos.com.
</Warning>

## FAQs

**What’s the difference between a monitoring address, a withdrawal address, and a payout address?**

 A monitoring address is used by Paxos to determine how much your organization has earned in rewards by holding, minting, and accepting USDG on-chain.
 A withdrawal address is an address your organization has registered with Paxos and can receive funds to on-chain from Paxos.
 A payout address is designated withdrawal address where Paxos will pay out your USDG rewards 

**Can I edit a monitoring address?**

 You can edit the nickname. Network and address are permanent. If you need to change a monitoring address, simply add a new address via the steps above. 

**Can I delete a monitoring address?**

 No. If unused, a monitoring address will simply earn 0 rewards. For bookkeeping purposes, we plan to introduce the ability to “delete” a monitoring address later in 2025.

**When do I need to add monitoring addresses by?**

Before the last calendar day of the month at 23:59 UTC+0.

**How does Paxos validate if a monitoring address is valid?**

We validate addresses using standard address formatting conventions:

- EVM chains: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#account-creation 
- Solana: https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts#account
