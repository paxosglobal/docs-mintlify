The Paxos Dashboard supports a multi-entity experience, made up of three components: [Organization](#organization), [Entity](#entity) and [Profile](#profile).
Within the Organization, individual access is selectively provisioned across Entities, so an individual can only access the information and funds and based on their [roles] within the respective Entity.
Most implementations require use of multiple Profiles to organize balances and transactions on the Paxos platform.

## Organization

When you [sign up for the Paxos Dashboard][account], you are creating [Organization Administrator][admin] credentials to log into a Dashboard Organization.
As the top of the hierarchy the Organization typically maps to the parent of a legal entity or business group, comprising one or more entities.

For example, if **My Company** is comprised of three separate legal entities, **My Company Asia**, **My Company Europe** and **My Company North America**, using **My Company** as the organization will enable you to onboard the entities, using the legal business names, within the same organization bucket.

## Entity

Entities, typically mapped to teams, business groups, holding companies, or separate legal entities, are onboarded within the [Organization](#organization).

- Funds are segregated at the Entity level.
- Users belonging to a particular Entity can see balances, transfers, and other information on in the Entity they belong to.
- Roles & Permissions, APIs keys are scoped at an Entity level. For example, if an Organization has 3 entities, User A has a Treasurer role in Entity 1, a Viewer role in Entity 2, and no access to Entity 3. See [Roles and Responsibilities][roles].
- [Organization Administrators][admin] who complete the onboarding for an Entity automatically become the [Entity Manager][manager] for that new Entity. Entity Managers are allowed to assign roles, add users, map identity provider groups to roles, etc. Entity Managers can be reassigned later

## Profile

Every entity has a system-generated default Profile.
Most implementations require use of multiple Profiles to organize balances and transactions on the Paxos platform.
Profiles are also used to move funds within the same Entity.
A Profile is equivalent to a crypto wallet, with the addition of holding your USD (fiat) balance.
For example, [depositing USD][deposit] into a Profile is the first step when [minting][mint] a stablecoin.
Those with the [Treasurer][treasurer] create Profiles.
