title: 'Organization, Entities and Profiles'
description: Learn more about the multi-entity experience.
---


The Paxos Dashboard supports a multi-entity experience, made up of three components: [Organization](#organization), [Entity](#entity) and [Profile](#profile).
Within the Organization, individual access is selectively provisioned across Entities, so an individual can only access the information and funds and based on their [roles](/guides/dashboard/roles) within the respective Entity.
Most implementations require use of multiple Profiles to organize balances and transactions on the Paxos platform.

## Organization

When you [sign up for the Paxos Dashboard](/guides/dashboard/account), you are creating [Organization Administrator](/guides/dashboard/roles#organization-administrator) credentials to log into a Dashboard Organization.
As the top of the hierarchy the Organization typically maps to the parent of a legal entity or business group, comprising one or more entities.

For example, if **My Company** is comprised of three separate legal entities, **My Company Asia**, **My Company Europe** and **My Company North America**, using **My Company** as the organization will enable you to onboard the entities, using the legal business names, within the same organization bucket.

## Entity

Entities, typically mapped to teams, business groups, holding companies, or separate legal entities, are onboarded within the [Organization](#organization).

- Funds are segregated at the Entity level.
- Users belonging to a particular Entity can see balances, transfers, and other information on in the Entity they belong to.
- Roles & Permissions, APIs keys are scoped at an Entity level. For example, if an Organization has 3 entities, User A has a Treasurer role in Entity 1, a Viewer role in Entity 2, and no access to Entity 3. See [Roles and Responsibilities](/guides/dashboard/roles).
- [Organization Administrators](/guides/dashboard/roles#organization-administrator) who complete the onboarding for an Entity automatically become the [Entity Manager](/guides/dashboard/roles#entity-manager) for that new Entity. Entity Managers are allowed to assign roles, add users, map identity provider groups to roles, etc. Entity Managers can be reassigned later

## Profile

Every entity has a system-generated default Profile.
Most implementations require use of multiple Profiles to organize balances and transactions on the Paxos platform.
Profiles are also used to move funds within the same Entity.
A Profile is equivalent to a crypto wallet, with the addition of holding your USD (fiat) balance.
For example, [depositing USD](/guides/dashboard/deposit) into a Profile is the first step when [minting](/guides/dashboard/mint) a stablecoin.
Those with the [Treasurer](/guides/dashboard/roles#treasurer) create Profiles.

## Leaving an Organization

Users can leave a Dashboard Organization at any time. The process depends on your role and the Organization's structure.

### For Non-Admin Users

Users who are not Organization Administrators can leave any Organization at any time:

1. Navigate to the [Organization page](https://dashboard.staging.itbitnonprod.com/organization).
2. Click the **Leave Organization** option.

If you accidentally created a new Organization during the sign-up flow, you can leave it immediately by clicking the user dropdown in the top right during the onboarding flow and selecting the leave option.

### For Organization Administrators

Organization Administrators can only leave an Organization under specific conditions:

**If there are other Organization Administrators:**
1. Navigate to the [Organization page](https://dashboard.staging.itbitnonprod.com/organization).
2. Click the **Leave Organization** option.
3. Ensure you transfer any critical responsibilities to another administrator before leaving.

**If you are the only Organization Administrator:**
- You can only leave if there are no other users in the Organization.
- If there are other users, you must first promote another user to Organization Administrator or remove all other users before you can leave.

<Warning>
Before leaving an Organization, ensure you:
- Transfer any funds or assets you are responsible for.
- Document any pending transactions or approvals.
- Hand off any API credentials or integrations you manage.
- Notify relevant team members of your departure.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If you need to close an entire Organization or Entity, contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) for assistance with the offboarding process.
