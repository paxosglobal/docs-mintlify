The [multi-entity experience](/guides/dashboard/organization) unifies multiple business entities in different regions under a single interface while enabling a customized view of the Dashboard to help users focus on their tasks while providing security around asset movement workflows.

Within an entity, [Entity Managers](/guides/dashboard/roles#entity-manager) can quickly [onboard a user](/guides/dashboard/admin/team) via passkey or SSO and delegate access and responsibilities to more users with role-based permissions and [team management tools](/guides/dashboard/admin/team).
