The [Paxos Dashboard](https://dashboard.paxos.com/) enables [treasurers] and other institutional users to securely [deposit] and [transfer] fiat, stablecoins and other assets, as well as [mint], [convert] and [redeem] Paxos-issued stablecoins.

The [multi-entity experience](/guides/dashboard/organization) unifies multiple business entities in different regions under a single interface while enabling a customized view of the Dashboard to help users focus on their tasks while providing security around asset movement workflows.

Within an entity, [Entity Managers] can quickly [onboard a user](/guides/dashboard/admin/team) via passkey or SSO and delegate access and responsibilities to more users with role-based permissions and [team management tools](/guides/dashboard/admin/team).

> To start using the Paxos Dashboard, [sign up for an account](https://dashboard.paxos.com/).
> If you already have an institutional account, it is easy to [migrate to the Dashboard].
