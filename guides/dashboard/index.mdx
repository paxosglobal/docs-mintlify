The [Paxos Dashboard](https://dashboard.paxos.com/) enables [treasurers](/guides/dashboard/roles#treasurer) and other institutional users to securely [deposit](/guides/dashboard/deposit) and [transfer](/guides/dashboard/transfer) fiat, stablecoins and other assets, as well as [mint](/guides/dashboard/mint), [convert](/guides/dashboard/convert) and [redeem](/guides/dashboard/redeem) Paxos-issued stablecoins.

The [multi-entity experience](/guides/dashboard/organization) unifies multiple business entities in different regions under a single interface while enabling a customized view of the Dashboard to help users focus on their tasks while providing security around asset movement workflows.

Within an entity, [Entity Managers](/guides/dashboard/roles#entity-manager) can quickly [onboard a user](/guides/dashboard/admin/team) via passkey or SSO and delegate access and responsibilities to more users with role-based permissions and [team management tools](/guides/dashboard/admin/team).

> To start using the Paxos Dashboard, [sign up for an account](https://dashboard.paxos.com/).
> If you already have an institutional account, it is easy to [migrate to the Dashboard](/guides/dashboard/migrate-to-dashboard).
