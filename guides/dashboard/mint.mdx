This guide walks you through the standard automated minting flow (**USD \> Stablecoin**), where funds are sent via bank transfer and converted into stablecoins on supported blockchain networks. The steps are the same for USDG,  PYUSD and USDP.

<Tip>

Watch a demo: See the full minting flow from start to finish before getting started.

## **What You'll Do**
1. [Add a destination wallet address](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/mint#withdraw-address) (This is where you'll receive the stablecoin).
2. [Create minting instructions](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/mint#minting-instructions), which define:

* **How** you'll send USD to Paxos (SWIFT or ABA, DBS-ACT, CUBIX).
* **Which stablecoin** you want (USDG, PYUSD, USDP).  
* **Where** the stablecoin should go (wallet \+ network).

3. [Send USD to the Paxos platform](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/mint#send-usd) using the generated deposit details.

Paxos will automatically mint the stablecoin and send it to your wallet.

## Before you begin

### Requirements

- [A verified Paxos account](https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com/signin).
- A role (ex:Treasurer) with permissions to **Add** or **Delete** crypto addresses, and **Create Conversion Rules**.

### Supported Stablecoins and Networks

| Asset | Supported Network |
| ----- | ----- |
| USDG | Ethereum, Solana |
| PYUSD | Ethereum, Solana |
| USDP | Ethereum |

## ➊ Add Destination Wallet Address​

You must add a wallet address before minting. This is where your stablecoins will be sent. 

![Minting Add Address](/images/mint-add-address.png)

1. Navigate to [**Addresses**](https://dashboard.paxos.com/dashboard/addresses) in the Paxos dashboard.
2. Click **⊕︎ Address**.
3. Enter a **name** for the address and select the **blockchain network**.
4. Retrieve the external wallet address and paste it in the **Network Address** field.
5. Fill in the [beneficiary details](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/travel-rule) requirements.
6. Click **Save**

<Tip>

Use the [**Approvals**](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/admin/approvals) functionality to require additional team members to review any new addresses before they are saved. 
This avoids potential mistakes around incorrect addresses and adds an extra layer of security. **Only approved addresses** can be used in any mint process. 

</Tip>

## ➋ Create Minting Instructions​
Once your wallet address is added, configure the minting rules for USD > Stablecoin.

<Info>

Minting instructions are reusable and immutable. Access [Saved Instructions](https://dashboard.paxos.com/dashboard/saved-instructions) to reuse them anytime you want to mint the same asset. 

</Info>

1. Go to [**Dashboard**](https://dashboard.paxos.com/) **> Convert**.  
2. Select **USD** as the asset you have. <br />![Minting Asset You Have](/images/mint-asset-you-have.png)
3. Select **External Account/Wallet** and then the fiat network you use to send USD to Paxos. If you choose **DBS-ACT**, it may need to be activated first. [Contact Support](https://support.paxos.com/hc/en-us) for details. <br />![Minting Select Source](/images/mint-select-source.png)

<Tip>

Use the [**Paxos Profile**](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/organization#profile) option if you want to hold your stablecoin in your current account.

</Tip>

4. Select a stablecoin (for this guide we're minting [USDG](https://docs.paxos.com/stablecoin/usdg)).
5. For the destination, select **External Account/Wallet** and then choose one of the available networks and one of the existing **Addresses**.
6. Name the instructions. <br />![Minting Name Instructions](/images/mint-name-instructions.png)

7. Click **Generate Deposit Instructions** to review the minting instructions. You can also download them for reference when sending USD to Paxos. 

<Tip>

Test the minting instructions with a small amount before minting large volumes.

</Tip>

## ➌ Send USD to Paxos 
Use the [Deposit instructions](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/deposit) to send wire funds to Paxos. 

<Warning>

![Minting Account Identifier](/images/mint-account-identifier.png)

</Warning>

Once the funds are received, Paxos automatically executes the minting instructions and sends the requested stablecoin to the specified wallet.

## ➍ Review Transaction Status​

Track your minting progress from the **Transactions >Asset Movements** section. You'll see two entries:

- **Fiat Deposit**: It usually takes a minute or two for the system to show the associated  
- **Crypto Withdraw**: The actual crypto withdraw may take anywhere from seconds to hours, depending on the blockchain, mint amount and off-business-hour transactions.

Transactions have the following status:

- **Pending**: The transaction is executing, which may include a manual review. If a transaction is pending for an extended duration, contact Support.
- **Failed**: If a transaction shows the failed status, contact Support.
- **Complete**: The transaction is successful.

<Tip>

Crypto Network Fees: Crypto network fees are calculated at the time of withdraw and deducted from the total deposit amount. Use the **View** action to see a fee breakdown and other transaction details. ![Minting Transactions](/images/mint-transactions.png) 

</Tip>

## Alternate Minting Flows​

Paxos supports manual minting flows with a number of different options. Following are a few options:

* [Deposit USD](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/deposit), then perform a manual [convert](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/convert) followed by a [manual transfer](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/transfer).  
* Use **Convert** to deposit USD and [convert](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/convert) it to a stablecoin, keeping it on-platform in the Profile of your choice, followed by a [manual transfer](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/transfer).

<Tip>

Can't find the right minting options? The desired option may not be supported by the [Entity](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/organization#entities) or by the Paxos platform. Reach out to your [Entity Manager](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/roles#entity-manager) or [contact us](https://support.paxos.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for help.
