The Paxos platform supports [Travel Rule][travel-rule] as part of our Crypto Transfers product to ensure compliance with our regulators in certain geographies.
The Crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) like banks, exchanges, custodial solutions, and financial services providers to identify and share details of the origin and destination of crypto transactions above a specific threshold, similar to how these details are shared between banks when making fiat wire transfers.
[Entities] onboarded to certain geographies must adhere to Travel Rule checks when depositing and withdrawing crypto to and from the Paxos platform.
