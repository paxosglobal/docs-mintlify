Once the credentials are activated, most users find success using one of the libraries on the [OAuth2 website](https://oauth.net/code) for authentication.

> To add or modify API Credentials, you'll need a [Developer](/guides/dashboard/roles#developer) or other role with appropriate permissions. Contact your [Entity Manager](/guides/dashboard/roles#entity-manager) for help.

## Add API Credentials

1. Log in to your Dashboard account and go to [API Management](https://dashboard.paxos.com/admin/api).
1. Click **API Credentials**.
1. Create a **Label** for your API credentials.
1. Select the **Scopes** for your **Client ID**. For example, the following scopes (space delimited) should be adequate to [mint](/guides/dashboard/mint), [redeem](/guides/dashboard/redeem) and [convert](/guides/dashboard/convert) Paxos-issued stablecoins:

<Scopes />

1. Optional: Add **Allowable IP** addresses. If you have a single IP address, you can configure a CIDR entry to specify a single IP with 32 fixed bits by appending `/32` to the address. For example, using `000.000.0.000/32` will allow only the IP address `000.000.0.000`.
1. Optional: Enable **Request Signing**.
1. Click **Create Credentials**.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and store them in a safe place. The secret will not be displayed in the UI again, and it will have to be reset if forgotten.

## Update or Delete Credentials

To make changes to an existing client, select it from **API Credentials** and click either **Edit API Credentials** or **Delete API Credentials**.
