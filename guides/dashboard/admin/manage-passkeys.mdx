![Manage Passkeys](/images/preferences-manage-passkey.png)

Go to your account preferences in the top right corner and use the passkey manager to add or delete a passkey.

The Dashboard supports multiple passkeys for each individual user.
However, availability of this feature depends on the technology used to create your first passkey.
If you get an error message when trying to create a new passkey, the functionality is not available for your setup.

The passkey labeled **Accessed from this browser** is the one used to log in during the current session.
You must have at least two passkeys associated with your account to enable deletion.
