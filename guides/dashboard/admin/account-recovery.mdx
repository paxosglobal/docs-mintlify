If you've set up passkey-based login, you can add a security question as a secondary login method. This serves as a fallback for account recovery if you lose access to your passkey.

Follow these steps to configure your security question:

1. Sign in to your account.
2. Click the profile icon in the top right corner and select **Manage Security Questions**.
3. Choose a question from the list.
4. Enter an answer only you would know.

<Tip>
Avoid using any identifying information (e.g., your name, birthdate) or common answers (e.g., 123456).
</Tip>

5. Write down your answer and store it in a secure place.

<Warning>
For security reasons, the answer cannot be retrieved later.
</Warning>

You can update your recovery question at any time by following the same steps.
