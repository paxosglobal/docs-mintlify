[Entity Managers] view, search and manage user access at [Admin > Team Management > Users][users] and use [Admin > Team Management > Roles][Roles] to audit the list of permissions associated with a Role.

## Edit User Access and Roles

Users are marked as Active once they log into the Dashboard.
To disable user access or change Roles, use the Edit Status dropdown in the User Actions menu at [Admin > Team Management > Users][users].

## Use Passkey-based Login

Use **Invite Users** on [Admin > Team Management > Users][users] to assign Roles as part of inviting a new user to the Entity.
These roles can be manually changed later. 
Users can have different [roles][role-desc] across different [Entities][Entity].
When inviting users, it is recommended to provide organization-specific instruction on the proper use and storage of [passkeys][passkey].

<PasskeyNote />

Once invited, the user receives an invitation email that includes a link to [register and create a passkey][passkey-first].
Upon generating the passkey, users can then [sign in via passkey][pass-login].

## Set Up Single-Sign-On

An Entity Manager uses the [Role Mapping interface][sso-mapping] to map Roles to user groups within your organization's Identity Provider.
These groups are typically set up as by IT teams who configure Identity Provider setups (for example, Okta group attribute).
A user's Roles are refreshed & validated on every login. 
Paxos supports SAML and OIDC supported Identity Providers for SSO (for example, Okta or Azure AD).

</Tip>

When adding a new mapping, enter the **Group Name** from your Identity Provider.
Typically, you work with your IT group to leverage existing groups; however, you may need to add new Identity Provider groups to match your expected Dashboard workflows.
Once you map the group to an existing Dashboard **Role**, the next time users [sign in with SSO][sso-login] their permissions will update.
