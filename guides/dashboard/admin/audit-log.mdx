title: 'User Audit Logs'
description: Track and review every user action within your Entity with full request/response visibility.
---

Go to [Admin > User Audit Logs](https://dashboard.paxos.com/admin/audit-log) to view a comprehensive record of all user actions performed within your Entity.

User Audit Logs provide full visibility into user activity, helping you maintain security oversight, debug issues, and meet compliance requirements.

## Key features

- **Full activity history** — Every user action (creates, updates, deletes) is recorded with who did it, when, and from what IP address.
- **Request/response visibility** — View the exact payload sent and the response returned for any action, useful for debugging or compliance review.
- **Sensitive data redaction** — Passwords, tokens, keys, and PII are automatically stripped before storage so they're never exposed in logs.
