## Filter events

Filter events by:

- **Created at**: Filter events by date
- **Event type(s)**: Filter by specific event types
- **Live or test events**: Toggle between live and test events

Click **View** for any event to see the full event payload.

Each event in the Dashboard links directly to its corresponding event type documentation in the [API Reference > Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks/identity-documents-required) section, where you can find detailed payload schemas and field descriptions.

## Undelivered events

Events may fail to deliver to your webhook endpoint due to network issues, endpoint unavailability, or authentication failures. When this happens, the event will show an undelivered status.

To recover from failed webhook deliveries, use the [List Events](/api-reference/endpoints/events/list-events) API to query for missed events.

For information about webhook delivery behavior, retry policies, and rate limits, see the [Retries and Limits](/guides/webhooks/retries-and-limits) guide.
