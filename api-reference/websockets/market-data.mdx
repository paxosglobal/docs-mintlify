## Overview

The market data feed provides real-time order book updates for all available markets. The feed delivers both initial snapshots and continuous updates to keep your order book synchronized.

## Message Types

### SNAPSHOT Messages
- **Initial Response**: Shows the complete order book state with bids and asks
- **Bids**: Prices in descending order with amounts
- **Asks**: Prices in ascending order with amounts
- **final_snapshot**: Always `true` in the initial snapshot

### UPDATE Messages
- **Real-time Updates**: Show executed trades and order book changes
- **Processing Rules**:
  - When `amount=0`: Remove the price level from the order book
  - When `amount>0`: Add or update the price level with the new amount
  - Use `side` field to determine whether to update bids (`BUY`) or asks (`SELL`)

## Multi-Market Handling

When streaming data for all markets, differentiate per-market updates using the `market` field in each message.

## Available Markets

Market availability varies by environment (Sandbox vs Production) and account restrictions. The feed may contain inactive markets or markets unavailable for trading.
