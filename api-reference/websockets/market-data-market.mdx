- **Bids**: Prices in descending order with amounts
- **Asks**: Prices in ascending order with amounts
- **final_snapshot**: Always `true` in the initial snapshot

### UPDATE Messages
- **Real-time Updates**: Show executed trades and order book changes for the specified market
- **Processing Rules**:
