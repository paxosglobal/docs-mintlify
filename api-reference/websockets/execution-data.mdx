## Channel

**Endpoint:** `/executiondata`

**Servers:**
- Production: `wss://ws.paxos.com/executiondata`
- Sandbox: `wss://ws.sandbox.paxos.com/executiondata`

## Overview

The execution data feed provides real-time trade information for all available markets. Upon connection, you will receive execution data for trades as they occur across all markets.

## Behavior

- **Initial Message**: The first message corresponds to the last execution at connection time
- **Subsequent Messages**: Each new message represents a new execution as it occurs
- **Idle Markets**: If no executions occur for extended periods, no messages are sent until new activity
- **Reconnection**: Upon reconnection, you receive the last execution (handle duplicates using `match_number`)

## Message Format

Each execution message includes:
- `market`: The market identifier (e.g., "BTCUSD")
- `price`: The execution price
- `amount`: The execution amount
- `executed_at`: Timestamp of the execution
- `match_number`: Unique execution identifier for deduplication
