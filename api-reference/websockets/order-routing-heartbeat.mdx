## Heartbeat Message Format

The server sends periodic heartbeat messages after you subscribe:

    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.123456789Z"
  }
}
```

### Message Fields

| Field | Type | Description |

## Heartbeat vs WebSocket Ping/Pong

The heartbeat channel operates at the application layer, while WebSocket ping/pong operates at the protocol layer:

- **WebSocket Ping/Pong**: Automatic transport-layer keepalive handled by the WebSocket protocol
- **Heartbeat Channel**: Application-layer liveness signal providing server timestamp and logical health status

Use heartbeat messages to verify that the server is not only connected but also actively processing and responding to your connection at the application level.
