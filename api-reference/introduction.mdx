# Paxos API Documentation

Welcome to Paxos APIs. At Paxos, the mission is to enable the movement of any asset, any time, in a trustworthy way. These APIs serve that mission by making it easier than ever for you to directly integrate Paxos product capabilities into your application, leveraging the speed, stability, and security of the Paxos platform.

## Getting Started

The documentation that follows gives you access to Paxos Crypto Brokerage, Trading, and Exchange products. It includes APIs for market data, orders, and the held rate quote flow.
