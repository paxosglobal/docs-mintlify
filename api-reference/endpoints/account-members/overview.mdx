description: "Account Members allow you to associate an Identity with an Account on our Platform."

Each Account can be linked to multiple Identities, which supports Joint Accounts (where two Identities have the ability
to transact against a single Profile).

Account members are effectively immutable. In order to update an account member,
clients should remove then re-add the account member with the desired state.

The API requires clients to have write access on the account and all identities
associated with the account.
