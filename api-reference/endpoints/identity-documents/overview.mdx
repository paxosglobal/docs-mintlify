Files can be updated multiple times by re-sending the document type for processing.

## Supported File Formats

We currently accept the following file formats:
- `pdf`
- `jpg`
- `png`

## Upload Process

Steps to upload a document are as follows:

1. Send a `PUT` request to `/identity/identities/{id}/documents` to get
   the upload URL.
2. Send your document to the provided URL via a PUT request. Take the following example using curl:
   ```bash
   curl --upload-file Proof_of_residence.jpg $URI
   ```

Uploaded document metadata will be available via `GET` request to `/identity/identities/{id}/documents`
