description: "Institution Members allow you to associate persons with an institution on our Platform."

Each institution can have multiple members, with each member representing the relationship to a person identity.

When creating an institution identity, you must designate at least one institution member.
This requirement ensures we have complete information about the institution's ownership structure
and key personnel, which is necessary to onboard institutions.
