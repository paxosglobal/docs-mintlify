For example, the option to buy BTC within the next 30 seconds for $8,000.

## Typical Quotes Workflow

The typical Quotes workflow is as follows:

1. Call [List Quotes](/api-reference/endpoints/quotes/list-quotes) to get the latest available
   quoted prices for the assets you want to buy or sell.
2. Present the offered price to one or more end-users, with a timer
   indicating the time to expiration.
3. If a user accepts the price, call [Create Quote Execution](/api-reference/endpoints/quote-executions/create-quote-execution) with the amount to buy or sell.
4. Call [Get Quote Execution](/api-reference/endpoints/quote-executions/get-quote-execution) to monitor
   for completion and know when the funds from the execution are available.

## Important Considerations

It's important to show end-users the latest available price. If you cache
prices to show them to multiple users, you should refresh the cache once
per second.

You can call [List Quote Executions](/api-reference/endpoints/quote-executions/list-quote-executions) to
review or construct reports on quote execution activity.
