There are three types of orders: market, limit and post-only.

Market orders guarantee execution at a variable price and quantity. Limit orders guarantee price and quantity at the time of execution but do not guarantee execution.
Post-only is an order type that will only be placed on the order book if it is the maker side of a trade.
