The Events API provides access to event data from your Paxos account. Events are generated when certain actions occur within your account, such as identity status changes, document requirements, or KYC refresh activities.

Events are immutable records of state changes that occurred in your account. They provide a reliable way to track the history of important activities and integrate with your systems using webhooks.
