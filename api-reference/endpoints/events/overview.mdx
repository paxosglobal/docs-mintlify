## Overview

The Events API provides access to event data from your Paxos account. Events are generated when certain actions occur within your account, such as identity status changes, document requirements, or KYC refresh activities.

Events are immutable records of state changes that occurred in your account. They provide a reliable way to track the history of important activities and integrate with your systems using webhooks.

## Webhooks Integration

Events can be delivered to your systems in real-time using webhooks. When you register a webhook endpoint, Paxos will send HTTP POST requests to your endpoint whenever events occur.

For more information about setting up webhooks, see the [Webhooks documentation](/guides/webhooks).

## Rate Limits

The Events API is subject to rate limits. See the [Rate Limits documentation](/guides/developer/rate-limits) for more information.

## Authentication

All Events API endpoints require authentication. See the [Authentication documentation](/guides/developer/authenticate) for more information.
