For example, the option to buy PAXG within the next 5 seconds for $3,000.

The typical Issuer Quotes workflow is as follows:

1. Call [Create Issuer Quote](/api-reference/endpoints/issuer-quotes/create-issuer-quote) to get a quote for the asset you want to mint or redeem to a specific profile.
1. Call [Create Issuer Quote Execution](/api-reference/endpoints/issuer-quotes/create-issuer-quote-execution) with the quote ID and profile ID.

You can call [List Issuer Quote Executions](/api-reference/endpoints/issuer-quotes/list-issuer-quote-executions) to review or construct reports on issuer quote execution activity.
