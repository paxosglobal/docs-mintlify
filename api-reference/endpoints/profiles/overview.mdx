Depending on your integration type, Profiles may be used to reflect both corporate balances or individual user balances.

## Profile Types

There are two types of Profiles:

- **`DEFAULT`** Profiles are system-generated.
- **`NORMAL`** Profiles are created using the [Create Profile](#operation/CreateProfile) endpoint and are the only type of Profile you can create.
