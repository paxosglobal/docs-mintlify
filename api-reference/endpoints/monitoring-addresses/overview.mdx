Paxos uses monitoring addresses to determine the amount of rewards your organization will earn. We recommend adding any addresses you expect to hold, receive, or mint Paxos stablecoins as a monitoring address in order to receive rewards for all of your qualifying on-chain activity.

## Important Timing

> Monitoring addresses must be added by month end (`23:59 UTC+0`) in order to earn rewards for that month. Addresses added after month end will start earning rewards for the following month.

## Availability

*These endpoints are only relevant for Global Dollar Network (GDN) partners.*
