## Orchestration Rule

If the orchestration begins with a deposit from an external source, use an Orchestration Rule.
- Define orchestration behavior for incoming deposits.
- Automatically execute the specified conversion when a deposit matches a rule.
- Remain active and in effect until explicitly deleted.
- Each rule is associated with deposit instructions that must be used by the sender.

## Ad-Hoc Orchestrations

If the source funds are already on the Paxos platform (e.g., held in a profile), use the Create Orchestration endpoint to initiate a one-time conversion.
- This endpoint supports sending the converted funds to either another internal profile or an external destination.
- Rules are not required for ad-hoc orchestrations.

<Callout type="warning" title="Stablecoin Conversions Deprecation Notice" icon="alert-triangle">
The Stablecoin Conversions API will be deprecated.

Paxos will migrate all active conversion rules to the Orchestrations API format by December 2025.

Customers should transition to the Orchestrations API to ensure continuity of service.
