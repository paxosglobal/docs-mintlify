title: 403 - Insufficient Funds
---

An Insufficient Funds error is returned on operations which require funding when the needed funds are not present in the profile funding the transaction.

For example, creating an order to buy \$100 of BTC will result in an Insufficient Funds error if the profile has an available balance less than \$100.

An Insufficient Funds error has the following "meta" fields:

- `profile_id`: The ID of the profile funding the transaction.
- `asset`: The asset needed to fund the transaction.
- `available`: The amount of the needed asset in the profile's current available balance.
- `needed`: The amount of the needed asset required to fund the transaction.

To resolve an Insufficient Funds error, assets of the needed kind should be transferred to the profile identified.
