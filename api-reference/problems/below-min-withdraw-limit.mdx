title: 400 - Below Min Withdraw Limit
---

A Below Min Withdraw Limit error is returned when a withdrawal request is below the minimum allowed withdrawal amount for the specified asset.

For example, attempting to withdraw an amount less than the configured minimum limit for an asset will result in this error.

A Below Min Withdraw Limit error has the following "meta" fields:

- `asset`: The asset being withdrawn.
- `requested_amount`: The amount requested for withdrawal.
- `min_limit`: The minimum allowed withdrawal amount for the asset.

To resolve a Below Min Withdraw Limit error, increase the withdrawal amount to be at or above the minimum limit.
