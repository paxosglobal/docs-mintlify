title: 403 - Unavailable Market
---

An Unavailable Market error is returned when attempting to trade on a market that is currently unavailable or disabled.

For example, this error may occur when a market is temporarily closed for maintenance, suspended due to regulatory requirements, or permanently disabled.

To resolve this error, check the market status and wait for the market to become available, or select a different available market for your trade.
