title: 400 - Exceed Precision
---

An Exceed Precision error is returned when a request contains a numeric value with more decimal places than allowed for the specified asset or field.

For example, attempting to create an order with an amount that has more decimal places than the asset's precision limit will result in this error.

To resolve this error, round the value to the appropriate number of decimal places as defined by the asset's precision requirements.
