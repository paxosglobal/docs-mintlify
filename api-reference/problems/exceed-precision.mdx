title: 400 - Exceed Precision
---

An Exceed Precision error is returned when a request contains an amount with more decimal places than allowed for the specified asset.

For example, attempting to withdraw or transfer an amount with excessive decimal precision beyond what the asset supports will result in this error.

An Exceed Precision error has the following "meta" fields:

- `asset`: The asset for which precision was exceeded.
- `requested_precision`: The number of decimal places provided in the request.
- `max_precision`: The maximum allowed decimal places for the asset.

To resolve an Exceed Precision error, round the amount to the maximum allowed precision for the asset.
