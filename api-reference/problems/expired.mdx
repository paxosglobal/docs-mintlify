title: 403 - Expired
---

An Expired error is returned in response to operations acting on some resource that has expired.

For example, attempting to accept a time-limited quote after the quote has expired results in an Expired error.

An Expired error has the following "meta" fields:

- `expired_at`: The time at which the resource expired.

An expired resource will not become unexpired. The `expired_at` data is informational, for display to the end-user to give more informative feedback on why their request could not be completed.
