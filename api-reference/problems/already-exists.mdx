title: 409 - Rejected
---

An Already Exists error is returned on operations which violate an at-most-once or uniqueness constraint.

For example, an Already Exists error will be returned if:

- Create Order is called with an already-used `ref_id`
- Create Profile is called with an already-existing profile nickname
- Accept Quote is called on a quote which has already been accepted

An Already Exists error has the following "meta" fields:

- `existing`: The existing record which is the subject of the conflict (for example, the existing order with the same `ref_id`)

An Already Exists error may be benign if the client is retrying an earlier attempted operation which the client believes may have failed.

However, if the request is not a retry, then resolving the error requires changing the request to avoid the conflict.
