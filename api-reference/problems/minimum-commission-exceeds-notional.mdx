title: 400 - Minimum Commission Exceeds Notional
---

A Minimum Commission Exceeds Notional error is returned when the minimum commission required for a trade exceeds the notional value of the trade itself.

For example, attempting to execute a very small trade where the minimum commission fee would be greater than the trade amount will result in this error.

To resolve this error, increase the trade size so that the notional value exceeds the minimum commission requirement.
