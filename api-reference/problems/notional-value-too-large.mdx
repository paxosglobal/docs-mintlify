title: 403 - Notional Value Too Large
---

A Notional Value Too Large error is returned when the total notional value of a trade or order exceeds the maximum allowed limit.

For example, attempting to create an order with a notional value that exceeds the configured maximum for the profile, market, or trading limits will result in this error.

To resolve this error, reduce the order size to bring the notional value within the allowed limits, or contact support to adjust trading limits if needed.
