title: 400 - Exceed Max Withdraw Limit
---

An Exceed Max Withdraw Limit error is returned when a withdrawal request exceeds the maximum allowed withdrawal amount for the specified asset.

For example, attempting to withdraw an amount greater than the configured maximum limit for an asset will result in this error.

An Exceed Max Withdraw Limit error has the following "meta" fields:

- `asset`: The asset being withdrawn.
- `requested_amount`: The amount requested for withdrawal.
- `max_limit`: The maximum allowed withdrawal amount for the asset.

To resolve an Exceed Max Withdraw Limit error, reduce the withdrawal amount to be at or below the maximum limit, or contact support to discuss limit adjustments.
