An Exceed Max Withdraw Limit error is returned when a withdrawal request exceeds the maximum allowed withdrawal amount.

For example, attempting to withdraw an amount greater than the configured maximum withdrawal limit for the profile or asset will result in this error.

To resolve this error, reduce the withdrawal amount to be within the allowed maximum limit, or contact support to adjust the withdrawal limits if needed.
