<Note>
**Preview API**: The Identity Controls API is currently in preview and is subject to change. Production usage should account for potential breaking changes.
</Note>

The Identity Controls API provides management of various lifecycle actions on the Identity. This API replaces the
deprecated `user_disabled` and `admin_disabled` fields on the Identity API and expands allowing finer grained reasons and new types (`DORMANT`) of controls.

## Available Endpoints

### List Identity Controls
**GET /v2/identity/controls**
List all controls for an identity. Returns both active and deleted controls based on query parameters.

### Create Identity Control
**POST /v2/identity/controls**
Create a new control for an identity. Clients can only create `CLOSED` or `DORMANT` controls.

### Delete Identity Control
**DELETE /v2/identity/controls**
Delete a control to reactivate an identity. Only `CLIENT` controls can be deleted.

## Authentication

All endpoints require OAuth2 authentication with the following scopes:

- **`identity:read_identity_control`**: Required for listing controls
- **`identity:write_identity_control`**: Required for creating and deleting controls

## Control Types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOSED` | Identity is closed, common reasons include `END_USER_REQUESTED` or `COMPLIANCE` |
| `DORMANT` | Identity is dormant due to inactivity |

Being `CLOSED` or `DORMANT` will affect the Identity's ability to perform actions on the Platform.

## Control Ownership
Controls created via `CreateIdentityControl` create will be `set_by:CLIENT` and you'll be able to delete these controls. 
In some scenarios paxos will enforce an account closure or other type of control and you'll not be able to delete these controls.

| Set By | Can Delete | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLIENT` | ✓ | Controls set by your integration |
| `PAXOS` | ✗ | Controls enforced by Paxos for compliance or risk reasons |

## Response Format

All endpoints return controls in the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "59b8e3c5-2b6e-4fa6-afcf-8c685598241d",
  "type": "CLOSED",
  "set_by": "CLIENT",
  "reason_code": "END_USER_REQUESTED",
  "reason": "User requested account closure",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "deleted_at": null
}
```

## Migration from Legacy Fields

Identity Controls replaces the deprecated `user_disabled` and `admin_disabled` boolean fields. Existing identities with these fields set will be automatically migrated to use Identity Controls. During the transition period, both the legacy fields and Identity Controls will be supported.

**Migration mapping:**
- `user_disabled: true` → Identity Control with `set_by: CLIENT` and `type: CLOSED`
- `admin_disabled: true` → Identity Control with `set_by: PAXOS` and `type: CLOSED`
