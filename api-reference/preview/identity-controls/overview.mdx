<Note>
**Preview API**: The Identity Controls API is currently in preview and is subject to change. Production usage should account for potential breaking changes.
</Note>

The Identity Controls API provides management of various lifecycle actions on the Identity. This API replaces the
deprecated `user_disabled` and `admin_disabled` fields on the Identity API and expands allowing finer grained reasons and new types (`DORMANT`) of controls.

## Available Endpoints

### List Identity Controls
**GET /v2/identity/controls**
List all controls for an identity. Returns both active and deleted controls based on query parameters.

### Create Identity Control
**POST /v2/identity/controls**
Create a new control for an identity. Clients can only create `CLOSED` or `DORMANT` controls.

### Delete Identity Control
**DELETE /v2/identity/controls**
Delete a control for an identity. Clients can only delete controls managed by `CLIENT`.

## Authentication

All endpoints require OAuth2 authentication with the following scopes:

- **`identity:read_identity_control`**: Required for listing controls
- **`identity:write_identity_control`**: Required for creating and deleting controls

## Control Types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOSED` | Identity is closed, common reasons include `END_USER_REQUESTED` or `COMPLIANCE` |
| `DORMANT` | Identity is dormant due to inactivity |

Being `CLOSED` or `DORMANT` will affect the Identity's ability to perform actions on the Platform.

## Control Management
Controls created via `CreateIdentityControl` will be `managed_by:CLIENT`, so clients will be able to delete these controls.
In some scenarios Paxos will set controls (e.g to enforce an account closure or other type of control) that are `managed_by:PAXOS`, which may not be deleted by clients.

| set_by | managed_by | Can Delete | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLIENT` | `CLIENT` | ✓ | Controls managed by your integration |
| `PAXOS` | `CLIENT` | ✓ | Controls created by Paxos, but managed by your integration |
| `PAXOS` | `PAXOS` | ✗ | Controls enforced by Paxos |

## Response Format

All endpoints return controls in the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": "ae54b3b4-cce6-4707-b34b-c9c4f0537798",
    "type": "DORMANT",
    "set_by": "PAXOS",
    "managed_by": "CLIENT",
    "reason_code": "DORMANT",
    "reason": "No activity for 180 days",
    "created_at": "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z",
    "deleted_at": "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
}
```

## Migration from Legacy Fields

Identity Controls replaces the deprecated `user_disabled` and `admin_disabled` boolean fields. Existing identities with these fields set will be automatically migrated to use Identity Controls. During the transition period, both the legacy fields and Identity Controls will be supported.

**Migration mapping:**
- `user_disabled: true` → Identity Control with `managed_by: CLIENT` and `type: CLOSED`
- `admin_disabled: true` → Identity Control with `managed_by: PAXOS` and `type: CLOSED`
