description: Manage dormant identities on the Paxos Platform.

## Overview

The Identity Dormancy feature enables you to manage identities that have become inactive.
Use Identity Controls to mark or unmark identities as dormant and the Identity API to monitor their status.

**Key capabilities:**
- Query identities with detailed status information, including active controls such as dormancy
- Set and remove identity controls on identities
- Filter identities by active control type and reason code
- Track identity control lifecycle with creation and deletion timestamps

## Understanding Dormancy Controls

Dormancy is a new type of identity control that marks an identity as inactive, changing its status to `DISABLED`.
An identity marked as dormant may continue to hold assets, but is disallowed from initiating new transactions until it is no longer dormant.

Paxos will automatically set dormant identity controls on identities that have been inactive for an extended period of time.
You may manually set an identity as dormant via the Create Identity Control endpoint.
A dormancy identity control will typically have the `is_overridable` attribute set, indicating that you may remove the control via the Delete Identity Control endpoint.

### Control Types

| Type | Description | Set By |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `CLOSED` | Identity is closed and in a "sell-only" state | Client or Paxos |
| `FROZEN` | Identity is frozen due to compliance reasons | Paxos |
| `DORMANT` | Identity is dormant and unable to initiate new transactions | Client or Paxos |

### Reason Codes

| Code | Description | Typical Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `INACTIVITY` | Identity inactive for specified period | Automated dormancy workflows |
| `END_USER_REQUESTED` | User requested the control | Manual account closure |
| `COMPLIANCE` | Regulatory or compliance requirement | Paxos-initiated controls |
| `OTHER` | Miscellaneous reason | Custom scenarios |

### Identity Status Impact

When a dormant control is active, the identity status changes to `DISABLED`.
The identity's `status_details` field provides comprehensive information about an identity's current state, the active control:

```json
{
  "id": "f190b163-208f-4d73-8deb-4fb8b24add00",
  "status": "DISABLED",
  "status_details": {
    "active_controls": [
      {
        "id": "59b8e3c5-2b6e-4fa6-afcf-8c685598241d",
        "type": "DORMANT",
        "set_by": "PAXOS",
        "is_overridable": true,
        "reason_code": "DORMANT",
        "reason": "No activity for 180 days",
        "created_at": "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Workflow

### ➊ Set Dormant Control

Mark an identity as dormant using the Create Identity Control endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.paxos.com/v2/identity/controls" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identity_id": "f190b163-208f-4d73-8deb-4fb8b24add00",
    "type": "DORMANT",
    "reason_code": "INACTIVITY",
    "reason": "No activity for 180 days"
  }'
```

The identity's status immediately changes to `DISABLED` and operations are blocked.

### ➋ List Dormant Identities

Query all identities with dormant identity controls using the List Identities endpoint.

**Filter by dormant control type:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.paxos.com/identity/identities?control_type=DORMANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

### ➌ Check Identity Details

Retrieve a specific identity to view its complete status including active controls, pending requirements, and failed requirements.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.paxos.com/identity/identities/{identity_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

### ➍ View Identity Control History

List active identity controls for an identity.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.paxos.com/v2/identity/controls?identity_id={identity_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

Include identity controls that have been previously deleted.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.paxos.com/v2/identity/controls?identity_id={identity_id}&include_deleted=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "59b8e3c5-2b6e-4fa6-afcf-8c685598241d",
      "type": "DORMANT",
      "set_by": "PAXOS",
      "is_overridable": true,
      "reason_code": "DORMANT",
      "reason": "No activity for 180 days",
      "created_at": "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "59b8e3c5-2b6e-4fa6-afcf-8c685598241d",
      "type": "CLOSED",
      "set_by": "CLIENT",
      "is_overridable": true,
      "reason_code": "END_USER_REQUEST",
      "reason": "User requested account closure",
      "created_at": "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z",
      "deleted_at": "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
    }
  ],
  "next_page_cursor": ""
}
```

### ➎ Remove Dormant Control

Reactivate a dormant identity by deleting the control.

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.paxos.com/v2/identity/controls" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identity_id": "f190b163-208f-4d73-8deb-4fb8b24add00",
    "id": "ae54b3b4-cce6-4707-b34b-c9c4f0537798",
    "reason": "User returned and requested reactivation"
  }'
```

The identity's status will be recalculated, typically returning to `APPROVED` if no other controls or requirements apply.
