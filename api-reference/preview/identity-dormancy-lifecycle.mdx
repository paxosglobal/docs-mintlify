description: Manage dormant identities on the Paxos Platform.

## Overview

Dormancy enables you to manage [Identities](/guides/identity) that have become inactive on the Paxos platform by marking them dormant to reduce costs.
An identity marked as dormant may continue to hold assets, but is disallowed from initiating new transactions until it is no longer dormant.
Paxos will automatically mark identities that have been inactive for an extended period of time as dormant.
You may also explicitly mark or unmark identities as dormant via the Identity API.

This guide will walk you through how to:
 - Set and unset identities as dormant via the [Identity Controls API](/api-reference/preview/identity-controls/overview)
 - List which of your identities are currently dormant

### Identity Status Impact

When an identity is marked dormant, the identity status changes to `DISABLED`. See the [identity status guide](/guides/identity/statuses) for more information.
When retrieving an identity via [Get Identity](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/get-identity), the identity's `status_details` field will include any active dormancy control:

```json
{
  "id": "f190b163-208f-4d73-8deb-4fb8b24add00",
  "status": "DISABLED",
  "status_details": {
    "active_controls": [
      {
        "id": "59b8e3c5-2b6e-4fa6-afcf-8c685598241d",
        "type": "DORMANT",
        "set_by": "CLIENT",
        "is_overridable": true,
        "reason_code": "INACTIVITY",
        "reason": "No activity for 180 days",
        "created_at": "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Workflow

### ➊ Mark Identity as Dormant

Mark an identity as dormant using the [Create Identity Control](/api-reference/preview/identity-controls/create-identity-control) endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.paxos.com/v2/identity/controls" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identity_id": "{identity_id}",
    "type": "DORMANT",
    "reason_code": "INACTIVITY",
    "reason": "No activity for 180 days"
  }'
```

The identity's status immediately changes to `DISABLED` and operations are blocked.

### ➋ Unmark Identity as Dormant

Unmark an Identity as dormant using the [Delete Identity Control](/api-reference/preview/identity-controls/delete-identity-control) endpoint.

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.paxos.com/v2/identity/controls" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identity_id": "{identity_id}",
    "id": "ae54b3b4-cce6-4707-b34b-c9c4f0537798",
    "reason": "User returned and requested reactivation"
  }'
```

### ➌ List Dormant Identities

Query all identities with dormant identity controls using the [List Identities](/api-reference/endpoints/identity/list-identities) endpoint.

**Filter by dormant control type:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.paxos.com/identity/identities?control_type=DORMANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

Once an identity is no longer dormant, the identity will typically returning to the `APPROVED` status after re-screening if no other controls or requirements apply.
You can listen for an [identity status change event](/api-reference/events/identity-status-change-object) via [Paxos Webhooks](/guides/webhooks) to be notified when the identity's status changes.
If the identity remains in the `DISABLED` state, then you can check the identity's `status_details` field to understand why.
