<Note>
**Preview API**: The Identity Controls API is currently in preview and is subject to change. Production usage should account for potential breaking changes.
</Note>

The Identity Controls API provides programmatic management of identity lifecycle states and activity controls. This API replaces the deprecated `user_disabled` and `admin_disabled` fields with a more flexible control system.

## Available Endpoints

### List Identity Controls
**GET /v2/identity/controls**
List all controls for an identity. Returns both active and deleted controls based on query parameters.

### Create Identity Control
**POST /v2/identity/controls**
Create a new control for an identity. Clients can only create `DISABLED` or `DORMANT` controls.

### Delete Identity Control
**DELETE /v2/identity/controls**
Delete a control to reactivate an identity. Only `CLIENT` controls can be deleted.

## Authentication

All endpoints require OAuth2 authentication with the following scopes:

- **`identity:read_identity`**: Required for listing controls
- **`identity:write_identity`**: Required for creating and deleting controls

## Control Types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DISABLED` | Identity cannot perform any actions |
| `DORMANT` | Identity is marked as inactive |

## Control Ownership

| Set By | Can Delete | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLIENT` | ✓ | Controls set by your integration |
| `PAXOS` | ✗ | Controls enforced by Paxos for compliance or risk reasons |

## Response Format

All endpoints return controls in the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "59b8e3c5-2b6e-4fa6-afcf-8c685598241d",
  "type": "DISABLED",
  "set_by": "CLIENT",
  "reason_code": "END_USER_REQUESTED",
  "reason": "User requested account closure",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "deleted_at": null
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns errors in Problem Details format (RFC 7807):

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Invalid request format or missing required fields"
}
```

## Rate Limits

Standard Paxos API rate limits apply. See the [API Rate Limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) documentation for details.

## Planned Enhancements

We are considering the following improvements to better integrate Identity Controls across the platform:

### List Identities Integration
The List Identities API may be enhanced to:
- **Return controls in response**: Include active controls directly in the identity list response
- **Filter by control type**: Query identities by specific control types (e.g., `DISABLED`, `DORMANT`)
- **Filter by reason code**: Find identities with specific reason codes (e.g., `END_USER_REQUESTED`, `COMPLIANCE`)

This will enable more efficient querying of identities based on their control states without requiring separate API calls.
