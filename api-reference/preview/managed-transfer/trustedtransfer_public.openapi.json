Only when all parties are in agreement and assets are fully funded does the Settlements API allow for change of custody. Upon completion, all settled assets are immediately available for trading, transferring, withdrawal or other supported activities.\n\nThe Source Profile initiates the transaction for the Target Profile to approve.
