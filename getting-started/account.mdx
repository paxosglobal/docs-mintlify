description: Sign Up for access to the Sandbox environment.
---

To create an account you will need an email address, the business name and country of incorporation, as well as a way to create a [passkey](https://www.passkeys.com/what-are-passkeys) using a [compatible device](https://www.passkeys.io/compatible-devices).

> Sandbox developer accounts are usually approved in less than one business day and take under an hour to create and onboard.

## ➊ Sign Up in Sandbox

Before you begin, ensure you are able to create and store a [passkey](https://www.passkeys.com/what-are-passkeys) on your device.
All modern [operating systems and browsers](https://www.passkeys.io/compatible-devices) support passkeys.

<Note>
**Passkey Required**: Passkeys are required to access the Paxos Dashboard. You'll need a compatible device to create and store your passkey securely.
</Note>

1. Go to https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com, select **Sign Up** and provide a name and email address to create an _Institutional (Business) account_. Individual account holders are not eligible for API access via the Dashboard.
1. Retrieve the verification code from the welcome email from Paxos and enter the code in the browser. If you don't get an email within a few minutes, check email filters and Spam/Junk folders for an email from `@paxos.com`. Contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com) if the email never arrives.
1. Create a passkey.
1. Provide basic business information. The **Country of Incorporation** and **What do you plan to use your account for?** fields determine which assets you will have access to.

## ➋ Onboard Developer Account

You have a choice:
1. **skip onboarding** which takes you directly to an approved account, or
1. experience the entire onboarding process, which you'd have to undergo in production

### Skip Onboarding
If you choose to **skip onboarding** then click the "Bypass Onboarding" button which appears on the overall progress page next to the "Get Started" button.
Then proceed to the ➍ **Enable Developer Access** instructions on this page.

### Experience the Onboarding Process
Otherwise, click the "Get Started" button and complete the first six onboarding steps.

<Tip>
Use stubbed (fake) text when entering data.
The information provided will not be used when creating the production account.
</Tip>

1. **Business Details**. Selecting **Corporation** as the institution type provides the quickest experience. The country field is pre-populated with the information you provided when creating the account.
1. **Funding Details**. Select **No** for the trust structure and nominee shareholder options.
1. Some account types will require you to fill out the **Suitability Assessment**. If you are not presented with this option, go to the next step. If you see the assessment: Select **Yes** and **Advanced** for the first two options.
1. **Business Members**. Open the edit dialog for the name you gave during account creation and provide the required fields. <mark style={{ background: "yellow" }}>You can use fake (dummy) text</mark>.
    - **Beneficial Owner Designation**. Ensure **Yes** is selected. Give information. The **% ot Ownership** should be `100`.
    - For **Authorized User Designation**, **Persons with Management Control Designation** and **Director Designation**, select **Yes**.
1.  Accept the **Terms & Conditions** and **Pricing & Fees** then complete **Review & Verify**.

<Tip>

## ➌ Contact Support

[Support](https://support.paxos.com) must activate your Developer account before you can use it.
To ensure a smooth process, include your email address and business (organization) name when [submitting a request](https://support.paxos.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

You will receive an email from support confirming your Developer Sandbox account is good to go.

> Occasionally, [Support](https://support.paxos.com/hc/en-us) may reach out to you via email requesting additional information or if there is an issue creating the account.

## ➍ Enable Developer Access

<img src="/img/edit-roles.gif" alt="Edit Roles" style={{width: '40%', float: 'right'}} />

Once the account is activated, you are assigned the [Entity Manager](/dashboard/roles#entity-manager) role by default.
However, this role does not have write access to [Admin > API](https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com/admin/api), where credentials are configured.
You will need to add the [Developer](/dashboard/roles#developer) role to your user.

1. Go to [**Admin > Team Management > Users**](https://dashboard.sandbox.paxos.com/admin/team-management/users).
1. Under the **Actions** column, open the **Edit Status** dropdown and select **Edit Roles**.
1. Click in the **Edit Roles** form and select **Developer**.
1. Log out and sign in to start a new session.

> Once your user has the **Developer** role, you can [create API credentials](/getting-started/credentials).
